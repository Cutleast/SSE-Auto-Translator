== Description

SSE Auto Translator is an independent Windows app that allows you to translate entire mod lists with a high degree of automation.
Its main features include an automatic mod list scan that identifies the mods that need translation.
SSE-AT is then able to automatically search link:https://www.nexusmods.com[Nexus Mods] (and link:https://www.confrerie-des-traducteurs.fr[La Confrérie des Traducteurs] for French translations) for available translations, download them, and convert them to DSD format.
The downloaded translations are then combined into a new mod (the so-called _Output Mod_) and installed at the end of your mod list.
In addition, SSE Auto Translator offers an integrated editor that can be used to edit downloaded translations and create new ones.

== Features

* Automated detection of required translations
* Automated detection and import of already installed translations
* Automated scan for required translations on Nexus Mods
* Version-independent and non-intrusive translations via Dynamic String Distributor
* Combined database to automatically translate mod files that are completely covered by Vanilla strings or other installed translations
* Built-in editor for creating and editing translations
** Search and eeplace feature
** Built-in support for Google Translator (free) and DeepL API (API Key required)
** Export feature to share your own translations
* Import feature for manually installing translations
* Ignore list feature to completely ignore mod files that are falsely marked as "Translation Required"
* Deep scan feature to find incomplete translations
* Setup dialog for easy setup and introduction
* Status colors to quickly give an overview of the translation state of your modlist
* Supports Mod Organizer 2 and Vortex
* Bind to "Mod Manager Download" Buttons at Nexus Mods to conveniently download translations from Nexus Mods (especially relevenant for free users)
** this requires manual activation in the "Translations" tab
** "Auto-bind" is available in settings (experimental)
*** with this enabled, SSE-AT gets auto-linked to Mod Manager Downloads on startup and unlinked when closed
*** experimental, because a crash might prevent unlinking
* Support for French translation website link:https://www.confrerie-des-traducteurs.fr[La Confrérie des Traducteurs]

== Limitations

* Only plugin files (.esp, .esm, .esl) and interface translations (interface/*_<language>.txt) are currently supported
* Translations that are not on a separate modpage and/or linked (under "Translations") on the original modpage cannot automatically be found by SSE-AT unless linked in a masterlist
** Masterlists are a way to link to translations that are not linked from the original mod like regular translations, for eg. the german translation for link:https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49616?tab=files[Unofficial Skyrim Modder's Patch]
** They have to be maintained by volunteers but so far, there is only a small masterlist for German
** If you're interested in maintaining a masterlist for your language, contact us (@cutleast or @wuerfhust) on the link:https://discord.gg/pqEHdWDf8z[Official Modding Forge Discord server]
* Vortex: SSE-AT and Vortex must not be run at the same time!
** This is a limitation of Vortex's database which only allows one app to access it at a time
