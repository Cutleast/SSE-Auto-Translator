= Translation Editor

SSE-AT has an integrated translation editor for manually creating and editing translations.
The editor can be opened either by creating a translation for a mod or mod file or by editing an installed translation.

== Import a translation

To manually import an existing translation for a mod or mod file, just drag its downloaded archive file (.zip, .rar, .7z) from the file explorer to SSE-AT and drop it on the "Translations" list.
SSE-AT will then import the translation for all mod files that are installed in the loaded mod list and not marked as green (= _Translation installed_ / _Already in target language_).

Alternatively, use the image:import.svg[width=24px,height=24px] _Import translation from local disk_ button in the toolbar right above the "Translations" list.

== Create a translation

To create a new translation for a mod or mod file, make a right click on the mod / mod file and click on _Create new translation..._ .
The option is only available if the mod or mod file contains translatable strings and there is no translation already installed for it.

SSE-AT will then create a new translation for the mod or the mod file and attempt to pre-translate all strings that are covered by the installed translations.
Exact matches (id and original string) with existing strings are marked in blue (= _Translation complete_).
Indirect matches (just the original string) with existing strings are marked in purple (= _Translation incomplete_) and should be checked manually.

== Edit a translation

To edit an installed translation in the database, make a right click on it and click on _Edit translation..._ .

The translation and all its mod files are then opened in the translation editor.

== Update a translation after a mod update

To update an installed translation for an updated mod or mod file, run a image:deep_scan.svg[width=24px,height=24px] _Deep Scan_ from the toolbar on the xref:main_page.adoc[main page]. +
This will check for strings that are missing in the translation and add them as untranslated strings.
After the scan is complete, the mod files that had new strings are marked in purple (= _Translation incomplete_) in the mod list. +
Now you can open the translation in the editor (if it is already open, you have to close it and open it again) and translate the new strings.
