For the path to Auri-El was not without its tribulations. The pilgrims struggled not only against the natural elements of the treacherous vale, but with a myriad of tests upon their faith and loyalty.\r\n\r\nIt is told that many simply could not continue on the path for long before turning back. Some argue that the rebuke they endured upon their return was crueler than any punishment that may have lay ahead of them along the path.

Regardless of each individual's tale, the final words remain eerily similar.

The turnkey asks what I'd like for my last meal.\r\n\r\nBring me paper, I say. A quill and a candle.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Jarl would like a confession. I would rather pass the time.\r\n\r\nWhen my father's harem burned down and our family fortune was lost to the ashes, my brother and I set to begging in the gutters of Elsweyr. I will never forget the first time we stole a traveler's purse. It was almost by accident. Just a slip of the claw and the pouch fell into our hands. We ate like kings that night. We slept in a warm bed for the first time in months.\r\n\r\nSoon after, my brother and I took up the knife. The gang we joined treated us as the dirty orphans we were. We robbed, we scammed, we cut and ran and years of debauchery and hard living took their toll. I lost half my left ear in a knife fight with a blind drunk Argonian.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to give up, but my brother, he dreamed bigger, better.\r\n\r\nMy brother wanted to make it to Cyrodiil and become legit merchants. We had a plan.  One final heist of a northbound caravan said to be filled with jewels.\r\n\r\nSomething went wrong. My brother could not stop the horses on time, and I stood helplessly by and watched the wagon plummet over a cliff. But as I picked through the wreckage, my devastation turned to excitement. There were no jewels, but there were plenty of luxurious wolf pelts, horker tusks and mammoth hides, more than enough to buy my way to Cyrodiil. I'd follow in the footsteps of so many of my kind. A traveling merchant, someone with a respectable profession.\r\n\r\nI had all the furs bundled in my pack when I saw my brother's broken body.  His ears were still warm, and I shut his eyes for the last time. This was his dream. And he would want me to go. But what I wanted, well, the caravan guards were coming.  I had to go, but I couldn't just leave his body to rot.\r\n\r\nMy brother gave me my first skin. It was to be a memento. But in the darkness of the fence's cabin, the coin hit my hand heavy. Then she looked at my brother's pelt and offered three times the amount of any other fur. Disgust caught in my throat, but did not live very long. I realized the cost of such a forbidden luxury. The value, the demand, the respect.\r\n\r\nThis is what I wanted.\r\n\r\nIt became easier. A dark alley, a gag in one hand and a quick slice across the throat.  Gently hold the body as it bleeds. I became faster, my cuts precise and fluid. I peel the skin with one motion and kept the merchandise pristine, in one piece.\r\n\r\nI became rich. Far richer than anyone in my family had ever been. Yet I was careful. My stronghold was well-hidden, and practically impenetrable. I hired the men that used to employ me. We moved frequently on less traveled roads when we hunted in the wild. We stalked the back alleys we used to sleep in when we hunted in the city. I grew so rich that I no longer needed to dirty my own hands.\r\n\r\nPatchwork colored furs fetched the best price among the Bosmer. Argonians preferred the pelts completely skinned and tanned. Orcs prized the thick, waterproof leather of the Argonians. Humans most often bought tails and ears. I had to employ an alchemist and a master craftsman for a couple odd requests, but I didn't ask questions when the gold piled up.\r\n\r\nAnd now I'm a prisoner. Maybe I became careless. Maybe I let too many secrets slip between the sheets. The raid of my fortress was a massacre. They took me alive, barely. That was their mistake.

I don't think the owner will mind if I take it. I really should spend more time around the docks, these Altmer are too thin blooded for my taste.\r\n\r\nAnyway, one of the tales in the book is an account of the \"Bloodspring of Lengeir's Feast,\" a fabled source of power for vampires. It is a story I've read several renditions of before but this version suggests that it may be located in Skyrim, in a ruin buried by quaking of the earth during the 2nd Era.\r\n\r\nConsidering that my business here with Inquisitor Amolmaire is, shall we say, at an end, it might be a good time to leave Summerset for a worthwhile diversion for the next twenty to thirty years.

We spoke much on my research into the Bloodspring and while she made sure to point out she thinks it a \"soft headed pursuit\" she did say that what she's heard would point to The Rift.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<b> ~ 5th of First Seed, 4E 201</b>\r\n\r\nAfter months of searching I finally may have found a lead. While looking for a bit of dinner in the Vilemyr Inn, I overheard an old hermit by the name of Jokull, talking about strange red water he found bubbling out of the ground.\r\n\r\nOnce I dispose of this soldier, I'll follow to see if I can find the location.\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<b> ~ 13th of First Seed, 4E 201</b>\r\n\r\nI can't believe I didn't realize sooner.\r\n\r\nJokull has been taking buckets of rock and dirt out of his house all week. When I realized that he's digging a basement I snuck in to check if he had uncovered the Bloodspring. He's hit a cave system that must be where Bloodspring has sunken into over the years. It was hard to see in the dim light, even with my eyes, but I would swear the water I saw pooled on the ground was red.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nUnfortunately he woke up while I was exploring the basement and he dropped his torch on a pelt as I killed him.

We've kept a low profile so as not to draw too much attention and thus far I've managed to keep them to only attacking hunters and other dregs, but we'll need to set up a ready food source that won't draw too much attention if we are to remain here.\r\n\r\nThe Bloodspring is not everything that I'd hoped it would be. Though it is blood and gives great strength it provides no sustenance. And the power it grants lasts only for a short while and carries a weakening of the body and mind with it.

Here at last is the breakthrough I have been seeking. All the dangers I have escaped, the traps I have eluded and the foul draugr I have avoided have brought me at last to this.\r\n\r\nIn my previous volume of notes and observations regarding Dimhollow Crypt's possible connections to the ancient vampire clans of Skyrim's history, I wrote of a great chamber, far larger than anything else I've yet seen here in the crypt. \r\n\r\nAlas, a few wandering draugr forced me to retreat to the earlier passages of the crypt, thus depriving me of an opportunity to study this huge cavern.\r\n\r\nWell, praise be to Stendarr, for as I write this, I have just spent nearly a full day exploring that very cavern. \r\n\r\nIt was a risk that proved more than worth it, because what I found in that chamber nearly defies description.\r\n\r\nCentral to this huge cavern is an island of stone in a subterranean lake. Upon this island is something I can only describe as an elaborate ceremonial construction surrounded by stone columns linked by arches. \r\n\r\nThere is no mistaking the stark contrast in architecture here; no ancient Nords made this stonework. Here, too, were more of the gargoyle statues that I first glimpsed in earlier passageways. \r\n\r\nThere is no draugr burial site in Skyrim that contains these statues, save Dimhollow Crypt.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I am now certain that the strange construct in this main chamber was built long after the crypt, and by wholly different masters. These must be the same builders who placed the gargoyles through the crypt, perhaps to frighten away the curious.\r\n\r\nAll signs seem to indicate that the masons who crafted these strange arches were servants of some ancient master who favored necromancy or vampirism. \r\n\r\nThe style and craftsmanship in the stonework are not only distinct in terms of design, seeming to speak of an entirely different culture than that of the old Nord peoples, but also in skill with which they were fashioned. \r\n\r\nThe cutting and shaping of the stone, for example, suggests more sophisticated tools than the crypt's original architects would have possessed.\r\n\r\nAlthough I feel a sense of exhilaration that my theories have at last been confirmed beyond any shadow of a doubt, I am also disappointed at the lack of answers. How long ago were these new features added to the crypt? And by whom? And for what purpose?\r\n\r\nOn one point, I have no doubts. I must return to the Hall of the Vigilant and share these findings with my brothers and sisters. When they see what I've discovered with their own eyes, they will no longer scoff at my theories or mock my endeavors.\r\n\r\nAnd when that is done, I will return to my work. For now, Dimhollow Crypt might be a mystery, but by Stendarr I will see that mystery solved.","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n ディムホロウ墓地に関する覚書\r\n 第3巻\r\n\r\n アダルヴァルド 著\r\n</p>\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n 神学者たちを称えよ！ ここに来て、ついにずっと求めていた大発見があった。全ての危険を逃れ、わなをかいくぐり、邪悪なドラウグルを避けた結果、ついにこの発見にたどり着いたのだ。\r\n\r\n ディムホロウ墓地と、かつてスカイリムに存在した太古の吸血鬼の派閥との間に見いだし得る関連性を論じた覚書と資料の前巻において、この墓地で目にした何よりも格段に大きな、ある部屋について述べた。 \r\n\r\n 悲しきかな、うろついていた数匹のドラウグルのために、墓地内で後戻りを余儀なくされた私は、この巨大な洞窟をじっくり見物する機会を奪われてしまった。\r\n\r\n いやはや、ステンダールは偉大なり。私は今、ほぼ丸1日を費やして、その洞窟を探検した後でこれを書いているのだ。 \r\n\r\n 危険ではあったが、そうするだけの価値はあった。なぜならその部屋で、およそ名状し難いものを発見したのだ。\r\n\r\n この巨大な洞窟の真ん中には、地下水の湖に浮かぶ石の島がある。この島の上には、アーチによって連結された石柱に囲まれた、精巧な造りの、儀式用の構造物としか説明できないものが建っている。 \r\n\r\n 建築様式の違いは一目瞭然だ。この石細工を造ったのは古代ノルド人ではない。ここに来る途中の通路で見かけたガーゴイル像が、ここにもたくさん置かれている。 \r\n\r\n スカイリムにあるドラウグルの埋葬場所で、このような像があるのはディムホロウ墓地のみである。\r\n\r\n 実のところ、私は今や、この中心となる部屋の風変わりな構造物は、墓地が造られたはるか後に、全く別の匠たちの手で造られたものだと確信している。墓地中にガーゴイルを配置したのも彼らに違いない。せんさく好きな連中を怖がらせ、遠ざけるためだったのではなかろうか。\r\n\r\n 全ての符号が、この奇妙なアーチを造った古代の石職人たちの雇い主が、死霊術や吸血症に対して好意的な人物であったことを示しているように思える。 \r\n\r\n 石細工の様式と造り手の技巧に関しては、古代ノルド人とは全く異なる文化を持つことを物語るかのような意匠だけではなく、製作に用いられた技術からも違いが見てとれる。 \r\n\r\n 例えば石の切断や彫刻の際に使った道具も、最初に墓地を造った人々が持っていたものより、ずっと洗練されていたようだ。\r\n\r\n 自らの理論が疑う余地のないものであることがついに確認できて、とても気分がいい。だが、さまざまな疑問が残ってしまったことで落胆もしている。この新要素が墓地に付け加えられたのはどれぐらい昔のことなのだろう？ それも誰が、どのような目的で？\r\n\r\n ある一点に関しては、何の迷いもない。私は番人の間へ戻り、この発見を同士たちに伝えねばならない。私の発見をその目で確かめれば、もう彼らも私の理論をあざ笑ったり、私の努力を茶化したりはしなくなるはずだ。\r\n\r\n それが済んだら自分の仕事に戻ろう。今のディムホロウ墓地は謎かも知れないが、ステンダールに誓ってその謎を解き明かして見せる。","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1VQ01Book","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02014018|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face='$HandwrittenFont'><font size='18'>\r\nminutes, but I finally managed to do it.

I feel like I'm missing a key ingredient, something of sufficient potency that can resist the forces trying to prevent my intrusion. Communing with the Ideal Masters has proved worthless. They speak in riddles and offer no assistance whether I ensure them a steady supply of souls or not. If I'm to escape Harkon's clutches, I need to keep the portal open long enough to carry me away from here... forever if need be.\r\n\r\n3rd Hearthfire\r\n\r\nI've done it! After wasting thousands of gold coins on components, I've discovered how to sustain the portal. I'm listing the components below without the proper amounts for my own protection. As a secondary precaution, I am combining my own blood into the formula which should prevent anyone from being able to duplicate it and following me into the Soul Cairn.\r\n\r\nThe formula consists of:\r\n\r\nFinely ground bone meal\r\nPurified void salt\r\nSoul gem shards\r\n\r\nUsing the proper measurements, place the above in the silver-lined portal vessel and add blood as a reactive agent.\r\n\r\nI will make my way into the Soul Cairn tomorrow after I gather my things and prepare for a potentially lengthy exile. More importantly, I must enact my plans with Serana, and get her to Dimhollow Crypt as soon as possible.\r\n</font>","string":"<p align=\"left\">\r\n<font face=\"$HandwrittenFont\">\r\n 収穫の月27日\r\n\r\n ハルコンの先見性のなさが深刻な問題となりつつある。くだらぬ予言は私たちに対する世間の注目を無暗にあおることになると、再三にわたって忠告しているのに、彼は私の言葉に耳を貸そうとすらしない。もはや私は彼にとって、妻というより苛立ちの種となってしまった。彼の馬鹿げた聖戦に付き合わされる中、自分の仕事に打ち込むことだけが癒しとなっている。\r\n\r\n 収穫の月28日\r\n\r\n 今日は大きな進展があった。素材の小さなサンプルを適切に用いて、転移門の器をソウル・ケルンに合わせて調整することができたのだ。転移門が開いたのは数分間のみだったが、適切な処方をすれば無期限にその状態を維持できると確信している。だが、重要な素材がひとつ欠けている気がする。こちらの侵入を阻もうとする力に抵抗し得る、十分な効能を持つ素材だ。アイディール・マスターとの懇談は無駄だということが分かった。彼らは謎かけを用いて話し、こちらが魂の安定供給を保証しようが、何の協力も申し出る気配はない。ハルコンの支配から逃れるには、ここを… ことによっては永久に離れるのに十分なだけの間、転移門を開いておく必要があるのだが。\r\n\r\n 炉火の月3日\r\n\r\n やった！ 何千枚もの金貨を素材に費やし、ついに転移門の維持方法を発見した。下に素材をまとめるが、我が身の安全のため、分量は省く。第二の予防措置として、処方に自分自身の血を加えておく。それによって他人が転移門を複製したり、私を追ってソウル・ケルンに入ったりすることはできなくなるはずだ。\r\n\r\n 素材表:\r\n\r\n 丁寧にひいた骨の粉\r\n 浄化された虚無の塩\r\n 魂石の破片\r\n\r\n 量を正確に測った上で、上記を銀メッキを施した転移門の器に載せ、血を加える。\r\n\r\n 明日、荷物をまとめ、長くなるであろう亡命生活への準備を整えた後で、ソウル・ケルンに入るつもりだ。だがそれよりも重要なのは、セラーナに関する計画を実行するということだ。そして彼女をできるだけ早くディムホロウ墓地に移すのだ。\r\n</font>","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1VQ04ValericaBook","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02014010|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face='$HandwrittenFont'><font size='18'>\r\nI am a hunter.

In the span of three short years, the great dwarven cities of Skyrim, from Markarth to the Velothi Mountains, fell before the armies of the High King. Cities that had held fast against the Nords for over a hundred years crumbled abruptly and without warning.\r\n\r\nFor centuries, scholars have marveled at the sudden collapse of the Dwemer city-states. Even the Nords seem to have been taken by surprise, though their chroniclers were quick to ascribe their success to King Gellir's inspired tactics and the blessings of Shor.\r\n\r\nMy research suggests a much different cause, however. In the decades preceding their fall, the dwarven cities of Skyrim had been decimated by internal disputes and infighting over a most surprising cause: Aetherium.\r\n\r\nModern scholars know Aetherium as a rare, luminescent blue crystal found in some Dwemer ruins. Most consider it little more than a curiosity, as it has proven all but impossible to work with: while it has a strong magical aura, it is alchemically inert, and no known process can enchant, smelt, mold, bind, or break it.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nTo the dwarves, of course, such problems were merely a challenge. In the years following King Harald's reign, the Dwemer discovered a considerable source of Aetherium in their deepest delvings. An alliance of four cities, led by Arkngthamz, the great research center in the southern Reach, was formed to oversee its extraction, processing, and study, and a new 'Aetherium Forge' constructed to smelt it under precisely controlled conditions.\r\n\r\nIf the inscriptions I discovered are to be believed, the results were nothing short of spectacular: the items produced by the Forge were artifacts of immense power, imbued from the moment of their creation with powerful enchantments. The dwarven alliance shattered almost immediately, as the four city-states and their rivals attempted to claim the Forge.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nWe can only speculate that none were successful. Decades of conflict merely weakened them all, allowing for King Gellir's subsequent conquests. And though the Dwemer reclaimed most of their lands a century later, there is no evidence that they ever resumed their research on Aetherium. Perhaps the costs had just been too great.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nBut nothing like the Aetherium Forge described in the inscriptions has ever been found within the borders of Skyrim. It may have been destroyed long ago, by the Nord invaders or the Dwemer themselves. Or perhaps it, like the secrets of Aetherium itself, still remains to be discovered.","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n エセリウム戦争\r\n タロン・ドレス 著\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<font

ドゥーマーの都市国家の突然の崩壊は、何世紀にも渡って学者たちを驚嘆させ続けている。ノルドたちですら不意をつかれたようだったが、彼らの記録者たちは、自分たちの成功をゲリル王の見事な戦術とショールの加護によるものとして、さっさと片付けてしまった。\r\n\r\n だが私の調査からはかなり違った原因が浮かび上がってくる。崩壊前の数十年間に、スカイリムのドワーフの都市は、実に意外なものを巡る論争や抗争によって、既に弱体化していたのだ。その争いの種とはエセリウムであった。\r\n\r\n 現代の学者が知るエセリウムとは、一部のドゥーマーの廃墟で発見された、ごく珍しい、冷光を放つ青い結晶である。だがほとんどの学者には、単なる珍品とみなされている。強い魔法のオーラを持っているが、錬金術的には反応が乏しく、知られている方法では付呪・精錬・鋳造・結合・破壊といった処理ができないため、研究がほぼ不可能だからである。\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n もちろんドワーフにとっては、そんな難点も取り組みがいのある課題にすぎなかった。ハラルド王の治世の後、ドゥーマーは自分たちが掘った最も深い穴の中で、相当量のエセリウムの供給源を発見した。エセリウムの採取や処理、研究、加えて精密にコントロールされた状況で製錬を行うために新設された“エセリウムの鋳造器具”を管理するため、南リーチにある大規模研究施設、アルクンザムズの指揮の元、4つの都市の間に同盟が結ばれた。\r\n\r\n 私が発見した碑文が信頼に足るものであるとすれば、その結果は正しく見物であった。その鋳造器具で造られた品々は、誕生の瞬間から強力な魔法が込められた、計り知れない力を持つ秘宝だった。4つの都市国家とそのライバルたちは、鋳造器具の所有権を主張することを企て、ドワーフの同盟はほぼ一瞬にして崩れ去った。\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n 企てに成功した者はいなかったとしか考えられない。何十年にも渡る争いは、彼ら全てを弱体化させ、結果的にゲリル王に征服の機会を与えたにすぎなかった。1世紀の後、ドゥーマーは自分たちの土地の大半を取り戻したが、彼らがエセリウムの研究を再開した形跡はない。おそらくコストが大き過ぎたのだろう。\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n だが、碑文の記述にあるようなエセリウムの鋳造器具がスカイリムの境界内で発見されたことはない。遠い昔にノルドの侵略者やドゥーマー自身の手で破壊されたのかも知れないし、エセリウム自体の謎のように、まだ密やかに存在しているのかも知れない。","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1LD_AetheriumWars","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02003F4D|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK

I am a redeemer. I am Jiub.\r\n\r\nThe tale of my rise to glory begins in the ash wastes of Morrowind. I rode alone, weapon at my side and the burning wind stinging my face. My quest was arduous, but necessary to ensure the survival of the Dunmer people. A pestilence was creeping across the ashlands, a menace with an insatiable hunger that plagued innocent travelers simply trying to get home. It was my self-sworn task to hunt them down one-by-one and drive them from the skies. Their fury knew no bounds and their war cry resonated across the land. They were the notorious cliff racers, and they had to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nOn a particularly hot day during Sun's Height, I was tracking what I called a Lingerer... a cliff racer without a nest. He was a particularly feisty one too, leading me on a merry chase across almost three miles of ash dunes. I had managed to take a piece out of one of his wings in an earlier scuffle so he couldn't maintain much of a climb, but he still had quite a bit of stamina left and he was trying to make me tire of the chase. Almost two solid hours passed and my silt strider was tiring, but I couldn't give up... I had sworn to eliminate the foul beasts to the last and I wasn't about to let it go. If I was going to stop the thing, I'd have to do it fast.\r\n\r\nI pulled my longbow from my back and nocked my last arrow. I took a deep breath and pulled, trying to keep the cliff racer in my sights. It was literally a longshot with the beast gaining distance and the silt strider bouncing me around at full gallop. Finally, with a silent prayer, I released the string. The arrow sang through the air like a howling demon as it sliced its way towards its target. Finally, just as it crested the lip of a foyada, the arrow struck it in the midsection. It let out a horrible cry and fell out of sight.\r\n\r\nMy cries of triumph were quickly stifled by the sound of over a hundred wings. Rising from the foyada was an entire colony of cliff racers and they were out for blood. The blasted thing had led me right to their nest and sacrificed itself with the intent of feeding me to its brood. It was a trap. The damned things had become much too clever. Knowing this was likely the end, I jumped down from the silt strider and hit the back of its leg with the flat of my glass blade. There was no need for the innocent thing to die here today because of my stupidity. As the ash cloud cleared from being stirred up by its massive legs, the cliff racer brood approached. I held my sword high and prepared for the worst.\r\n\r\nThe battle lasted two full days. I was beaten, clawed, bitten and knocked down more times than I care to remember. In the end, seventy-six cliff racers were slaughtered. I was knee-deep in their corpses and my body on the verge of collapse. But I had survived. I smiled to the heavens and all went black.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke, all I felt was my back on a cold stone floor. Every muscle in my body was on fire, and my vision was blurred. Slowly, I tried to climb to my feet. It took several agonizing minutes, but I finally managed to do it. As my eyes adjusted to the dim light of my new surroundings, I realized that I was standing before Lord Vivec himself. He was simply staring at me... floating above his throne and staring at me with his piercing eyes. When I began to prostrate myself as a sign of respect, he held up one of his hands as if to say it wasn't necessary. Was I dead? Was Lord Vivec pleased with me? Was he about to strike me down in anger for my somewhat sordid past?\r\n\r\nSuddenly I understood everything. Suddenly I realized that I was brought here for a reason. I should have died in those ash wastes, but Lord Vivec must have seen something inside me that he hadn't seen in millennia and decided to spare me from my fate.\r\n\r\nThus began my ascent to Sainthood. Thus began the rise of Jiub!","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n モロウウィンドの英雄にして\r\n ダンマーの救世主\r\n 根絶者 聖ジウブの\r\n 栄光と没落\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ジウブ 著\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/I_letter.png'>私は猟師だ。私は解放者だ。私はジウブだ。\r\n\r\n 私が栄光を手にするまでの物語は、モロウウィンドの灰捨て場から始まる。私は武器を脇にぶら下げ、ひとりシルトストライダーに乗っていた。焼けるように熱い風が顔を突き刺した。困難だが、ダンマーの生き残りのためには避けることのできない旅だった。ある疫病がアッシュランドを横切って忍び寄りつつあったのだ。無実の旅人たちを悩ました、飽くなき飢えを抱えた厄介者が、故郷に帰ろうとしていた。私は奴らを片っ端から仕留め、空から駆逐することを自らに誓った。奴らの狂暴さは限度を知らず、そのときの声は大地に響き渡った。奴らとは悪名高きクリフ・レーサーであり、撲滅せねばならぬ敵だった。\r\n\r\n 南中の月の、とりわけ暑いある日のこと、私は自分が“しぶとい奴”と呼んでいた相手… 1匹の巣を持たぬクリフ・レーサーを追っていた。元気の良さも桁外れで、灰の山の上で、奴が先頭に立って、ほぼ3マイルにもわたって楽しい追いかけっこが繰り広げられていた。それ以前の乱闘で私に片翼の一部をもぎ取られていた奴は、ほとんど上昇を続けられなくなっていたが、それでもまだかなりの体力があり、こちらの追う気を失わせようと頑張っていた。そのまま2時間近くが過ぎ、私のシルトストライダーも疲れ始めていたが、諦めるわけにはいかなかった… この邪悪な獣どもを、最後の1匹に至るまで抹殺すると誓ったのだ。まだその誓いを捨てる気はなかった。奴を仕留めるなら、急がねばならなかった。\r\n\r\n 私は背中から長い弓を引き抜き、最後の矢をつがえた。そして深呼吸をすると弓を引き、クリフ・レーサーに狙いを定めようとした。獣は遠ざかるし、全速力で走るシルトストライダーにはあっちこっちにはね飛ばされるしで、文字どおり矢が届けば幸いという状況だった。私は心の中で祈りながら、ついに弦を放した。矢は雄たけびを上げる悪魔のように、うなりを上げて空を切り、獲物に向かって飛んでいった。そしてついに奴がフォヤーダの縁に達したところで、その胴体の真ん中に突き刺さった。奴は恐ろしい叫び声を上げて視界から消えた。\r\n\r\n 私の勝利の叫びは、100を超える翼の羽ばたきで、すぐさまかき消された。フォヤーダからクリフ・レーサーの群れがひとつ丸ごと姿を現した。彼らは血を欲していた。あのいまいましい奴は、私を自分たちの巣まで案内し、同族に食わせるために自らを犠牲にしたのだ。わなだったのだ。いまいましい獣どもは、既に賢くなり過ぎていた。これで終わりだと悟った私は、シルトストライダーから飛び降り、その足の裏側を碧水晶の剣の平たい面で打った。罪もないものが、私の愚かしさのために今日ここで死ぬ必要はない。その大きな足で巻き上げられた一面の灰煙が晴れると、クリフ・レーサーの群れが近付いてきた。私は剣を高く掲げ、最悪の事態に備えた。\r\n\r\n 戦いは丸2日間続いた。打たれ、かぎつめでひっかかれ、かみつかれ、数えたくもないほど何度も打ち倒された。最終的に76匹のクリフ・レーサーが虐殺された。私は連中の死体に膝まで埋もれ、今にも倒れそうだった。それでも私は生き残った。空に向かって微笑むと、視界が真っ暗になった。\r\n\r\n 目覚めと同時に感じたのは、背中が冷たい石の床に触れているということだけだった。全身の筋肉は燃えるように熱く、目はかすんでよく見えなかった。私はゆっくりと立ち上がろうとした。何分か苦闘したが、最後にはどうにか立ち上がることができた。新たな環境の薄暗さに目が慣れるにつれて、私は自分がヴィベク王その人の前に立っていることに気付いた。王はただ私を見つめていた… 玉座の上に浮かび、鋭い眼差しで私を見ていた。敬意を表するためにひれ伏そうとすると、王は必要ないと言うように片方の手を上げた。私は死んだのか？ ヴィベク王の機嫌を損ねはしなかったろうか？ やや卑しい経歴のために不興を買って、殺されてしまうのだろうか？\r\n\r\n 突然私は全てを理解した。急に気が付いたのだ。何か理由があるからこそ、ここに連れて来られたのだと。私はあの灰捨て場で死ぬはずだった。だがヴィベク王は、その私の中に1000年に一度の逸材を見出し、私を死の運命から救おうと決められたに違いない。\r\n\r\n このようにして私は聖人への道を歩み始めた。このようにしてジウブの栄光は始まったのだ！","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1VQSaintFinalBook","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"020126C5|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Letter from Harkon","string":"ハルコンからの手紙","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1VQ03MalkusNote","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02006956|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Letter from the Vampire","string":"吸血鬼からの手紙","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1RH04Letter","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02014010|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Jiub's Opus (Page 1)","string":"ジウブの手記(1ページ目)","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1VQSaintPage01","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201A3E3|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<font face='$FalmerFont'>\r\n\r\nTOUCHING THE SKY\r\nPARMION SALDOR\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</font>\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<font face='$FalmerFont'>\r\nMANY OF THE MOST DEDICATED SNOW ELVES ONCE COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO A TIRELESS JOURNEY THROUGH THE CHANTRY TO THE TEMPLE THEY CARRIED WITH THEM THE PARAMOUNT DESIRE TO BECOME ONE WITH THEIR GOD AURIEL THOUGH ALL SET OUT WITH THE DETERMINATION TO PROVE THEIR WORTH, FEW WERE PREPARED FOR THE TRIALS THAT LAY AHEAD FOR THE PATH TO AURIEL WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS TRIBULATIONS THE PILGRIMS STRUGGLED NOT ONLY AGAINST THE NATURAL ELEMENTS OF THE TREACHEROUS VALE BUT WITH A MYRIAD OF TESTS UPON THEIR FAITH AND LOYALTY\r\n\r\nIT IS TOLD THAT MANY SIMPLY COULD NOT CONTINUE ON THE PATH FOR LONG BEFORE TURNING BACK SOME ARGUE THAT THE REBUKE THEY ENDURED UPON THEIR RETURN WAS CRUELER THAN ANY PUNISHMENT THAT MAY HAVE LAY AHEAD OF THEM ALONG THE PATH.

For months, Moric had been going on to the Vigilants about detecting mystical energies deep in the east mountains.  Said he'd found some old tomes about the ruins of \"Ruunvald,\" or something the like, a Nordic chamber thousands of years old.  I remember thinking \"Yeah, if it's so old, how come no one's found it yet?  There's plenty of adventurers wandering around these parts.\"  \r\n<br>Seemed like most of the other Vigilants agreed, we had more important things to do.

Falmer scholars theorize that this bowl would be placed under a drip of water coming from an overhanging rock and as the bowl filled, the water's level would reach these markings, thus indicating a crude passage of time.

Often our surroundings make it impossible to dwell on any happiness. We have been locked together in such close quarters for so long we grow tired of each other's company. Even the strongest of us have faltered with nothing to do but think on what is lost. I wake each day to forlorn faces and am reminded of where we are and all we have left behind.

Yet I cannot force the images of my own losses from my mind. And now in a time when our people should be banding together it feels we are drifting apart. The Nords have truly won. Our once great pride and unity are shattered. If we lose hope now we will never survive. Today many, myself included, have tried to speak out in voices of reason.

Inside, we will carry our truth and our scars.","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n フェア・アガーウェンの日記\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ファルメル語からの翻訳:\r\n マルカルスのカルセルモ\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n まえがき\r\n\r\n この日記の日付は原文を文字通り訳している。現代に知られている時間の単位の中に、この言い回しと合致するものはないが、このような形で月日を数える習慣があったものと考えられている。古代のファルメルの奴隷が暮らしていた洞穴からは、深いボウルのような形のしんちゅう製の器が発見されており、その内側には無骨なタッチで20個の印が刻まれている。ファルメル学者たちは、このボウルが水の滴る突き出した岩の下に置かれていたのではないかと考えている。岩を伝って落ちたしずくがボウルを満たし、この印に達すると、それによって経過した時間を大まかに知ることができるのだ。太古のファルメルに時間を測る仕掛けとして用いられていた器は、この日記から“クルニール”と呼ばれている。\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n 10個目のクルニール、3番目の印\r\n\r\n 潜伏生活に追い込まれてから、もう何年もの月日が経ったような気がする。万一この日記が発見された時に、この家の善良な人々が危険にさらされることのないよう、居場所については敢えて記さない。雪の王子の昔の知り合いだというこの一家には、ずっと親切にしてもらっている。彼は死んだ後も、その偉大な影響力で私たちの安全を保証してくれているのだ。旅の途中で人目につかずに大人数で移動するのが難しくなったため、多くの同胞と離れ離れになった。私たちは各々別々の道を進まざるを得ず、移動も夜に限られていた。他の皆の行方については何の知らせもないが、この先もそんな知らせが届くことはないのではないだろうか。私たちの生活は永遠に変わってしまった。\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n 10個目のクルニール、7番目の印\r\n\r\n 夜になると、過ぎ去った時のことを振り返らずにいられない。未だに時折眠りの中で、谷で遊ぶ若き者たちの笑い声を聞くことがある。スノーエルフの地ではあまりにも当たり前に存在していた幸せなひとときの色あせた残像が、ふと目の前をよぎることもある。こういう思い出にはあまり長く浸らないよう気をつけているが、周囲の環境がどんな幸せに浸ることも許さない場合が多い。長いこと狭い住まいに閉じ込められているせいで、私たちは互いにうんざりしつつある。仲間うちで最も強い者でさえ、やることもなく、失われたものを振り返るしかない日々に、活気を失っている。毎日目を覚ますと、そこに絶望した顔が待っていて、今いる場所と、置き去りにして来た全てを思い出させるのだ。私たちは皆隠れ家を出て、陽のあたる場所を自由に歩ける日が再び訪れることを心待ちにしている。だが私は、皆の中からそんな日がいつか訪れるという希望すら失われつつあるのではないかと懸念している。\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n 10個目のクルニール、10番目の印\r\n\r\n\r\n 女たちや子供たちの涙には飽き飽きだ。私自身の涙はもう枯れ果てた。男たちは私たちを皆弱者であるかのように思っているが、私たちも彼らと同じ苦難を乗り越えてきたのだ。戦でどれほどの同胞を失ったか、考えることすら耐えがたい。だが自分が失ったものの残像を、この心から追い出すこともできない。そして結束が必要なこの時に、私たちはばらばらになろうとしているように感じる。ノルドは真の勝利を収めた。かつて私たちが持っていた大いなる誇りと絆は、粉々に打ち砕かれた。今希望を失えば、生き延びることはできないだろう。今日、私を含めて多くの者が、理性の声に従って意見を言おうとした。未来について話し合うことなしに、希望を持つことなどできない。くじけた心のままでは、現状を変えることはできないのだ。\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n 10個目のクルニール、18番目の印\r\n\r\n 自分たちが再びスノーエルフとして、自由にこの世界で生きることができないのは分かっている。私たちは永遠に、なんらかの形で身を隠しながら生きてゆくことになるだろう。だが、私たちが陽の光や風を肌に受けながら暮らすことができないという理屈はない。ここには私たちの友となり、脅威が去った時には手を貸してくれようという人々がいる。今の私たちは生き抜く術を知っている。私たちは新しく生まれ変わらなくてはならないのだ。表向き私たちは、ここに属する者のようになるだろう。だが内側では、自分たちの真実と傷痕とを保ち続けるのだ。","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1FVBook03English","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02015D88|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Note","string":"メモ","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1SoulCairnRJPOI2Note","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"020192F0|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscovering Ruunvald\r\nVol. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby \r\nMoric Sidrey\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<font face='$HandwrittenFont'>I have decided to document our expedition to find Ruunvald in my journals, with hopes that, should we fail, it will bring illumination to those who follow us.

I am certain that there is some artifact of great power to be found in those ruins, one that the Vigilants could find useful in their mission.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to sound pompous, but I feel as if I am on the precipice of my destiny with this quest. I am certain we are digging in the right place. I can feel it in my bones, and I dream of finding Ruunvald at night.  Even in my waking hours, I can almost hear a reassuring voice telling me we are going the right way.\r\n\r\nThe expedition has had a great deal of luck so far.  After only a few weeks, the first tunnel broke through into a large shaft, leading downward towards where I suspect to find Ruunvald. With just a few bits of carpentry, we've established our first base camp within the mountains.
