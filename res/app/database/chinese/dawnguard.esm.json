align=\"left\"><img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>he end, when it came, was swift. In the span of three short years, the great dwarven cities of Skyrim, from Markarth to the Velothi Mountains, fell before the armies of the High King. Cities that had held fast against the Nords for over a hundred years crumbled abruptly and without warning.\r\n\r\nFor centuries, scholars have marveled at the sudden collapse of the Dwemer city-states. Even the Nords seem to have been taken by surprise, though their chroniclers were quick to ascribe their success to King Gellir's inspired tactics and the blessings of Shor.\r\n\r\nMy research suggests a much different cause, however. In the decades preceding their fall, the dwarven cities of Skyrim had been decimated by internal disputes and infighting over a most surprising cause: Aetherium.\r\n\r\nModern scholars know Aetherium as a rare, luminescent blue crystal found in some Dwemer ruins. Most consider it little more than a curiosity, as it has proven all but impossible to work with: while it has a strong magical aura, it is alchemically inert, and no known process can enchant, smelt, mold, bind, or break it.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nTo the dwarves, of course, such problems were merely a challenge. In the years following King Harald's reign, the Dwemer discovered a considerable source of Aetherium in their deepest delvings. An alliance of four cities, led by Arkngthamz, the great research center in the southern Reach, was formed to oversee its extraction, processing, and study, and a new 'Aetherium Forge' constructed to smelt it under precisely controlled conditions.\r\n\r\nIf the inscriptions I discovered are to be believed, the results were nothing short of spectacular: the items produced by the Forge were artifacts of immense power, imbued from the moment of their creation with powerful enchantments. The dwarven alliance shattered almost immediately, as the four city-states and their rivals attempted to claim the Forge.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nWe can only speculate that none were successful. Decades of conflict merely weakened them all, allowing for King Gellir's subsequent conquests. And though the Dwemer reclaimed most of their lands a century later, there is no evidence that they ever resumed their research on Aetherium. Perhaps the costs had just been too great.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nBut nothing like the Aetherium Forge described in the inscriptions has ever been found within the borders of Skyrim. It may have been destroyed long ago, by the Nord invaders or the Dwemer themselves. Or perhaps it, like the secrets of Aetherium itself, still remains to be discovered.","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n神光之戰\r\n\r\n\r\n泰榮．德萊瑟 \r\n著\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"17\">獻給我的摯友和同事\r\n卡提雅</font>\r\n</p>\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\"><img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>終結時刻來得快速。短短三年，從馬卡斯城至梅洛特山脈的眾多偉大天際省矮人城市，全為至高王的大軍擊潰。這些曾與諾德對抗數百年的城市，如今毫無預警地在須臾間分崩離析。\r\n\r\n好幾世紀以來，學者一直對鍛莫城邦的突然瓦解驚異不已。就連諾德人也似乎難掩驚訝，儘管他們的編年史學家立刻將之歸功於格利爾王的英明戰略和朔爾的庇佑。\r\n\r\n不過我的研究卻指向另一個相當不同的原因。在他們潰散前幾十年間，天際省的鍛莫城市早已因為層出不窮的內部紛爭而崩壞殆盡，而引起內鬨的罪魁禍首出人意料，竟是：神光水晶。\r\n\r\n現代學者已知的神光水晶，是種會發出藍色冷光的稀有晶體，多在鍛莫遺跡為人發現。大多數人也只解讀其為賞玩之物，因為它看似毫無實用性可言：雖然它有強大的魔法光環，但惰性極強，無以供鍊金使用，而且尚未有任何已知的方法得以將它附魔、精煉、鑄造、融合甚或擊碎。\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n當然，對鍛莫人而言，這些問題只不過是小挑戰。在哈拉爾德國王多年統馭的期間，鍛莫人在極深的地下探鑽過程發現了為數可觀的神光水晶。以南邊塞領的重要研究中心「阿肯塔茲」為首，四座城市結盟，監管神光水晶的開採、加工處理和研究，並設立全新的「神光熔爐」，以便在精確監控的環境下熔煉此晶體。\r\n如果我發現的碑文有其可信度，那麼這個聯盟的成果可謂驚人：該熔爐所產出的成品在鑄造的瞬間即具強力附魔，因而有浩瀚神力。鍛莫聯盟幾乎立刻便四分五裂，因為四個城邦都企圖將熔爐據為己有。\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n我們只能推測，他們全都失敗了。數十年的衝突對立只是大大損耗他們各自的能力，讓格利爾王有機可趁。儘管一個世紀後，鍛莫人重新奪回了大部分的領土，但卻沒有證據顯示他們曾重拾對神光水晶的研究。也許代價實在太高昂了。\r\n\r\n\r\n不過在天際省境內，從未發現碑文中所提及的這座神光熔爐。或許它早就毀於諾德人入侵，或甚至是鍛莫人親手將之摧毀。又或許，熔爐一如神光水晶之謎，仍待解開。","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1LD_AetheriumWars","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02019578|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscovering Ruunvald\r\nVol. II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby \r\nMoric Sidrey\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<font face='$HandwrittenFont'>Our luck continues!

I am a redeemer. I am Jiub.\r\n\r\nThe tale of my rise to glory begins in the ash wastes of Morrowind. I rode alone, weapon at my side and the burning wind stinging my face. My quest was arduous, but necessary to ensure the survival of the Dunmer people. A pestilence was creeping across the ashlands, a menace with an insatiable hunger that plagued innocent travelers simply trying to get home. It was my self-sworn task to hunt them down one-by-one and drive them from the skies. Their fury knew no bounds and their war cry resonated across the land. They were the notorious cliff racers, and they had to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nOn a particularly hot day during Sun's Height, I was tracking what I called a Lingerer... a cliff racer without a nest. He was a particularly feisty one too, leading me on a merry chase across almost three miles of ash dunes. I had managed to take a piece out of one of his wings in an earlier scuffle so he couldn't maintain much of a climb, but he still had quite a bit of stamina left and he was trying to make me tire of the chase. Almost two solid hours passed and my silt strider was tiring, but I couldn't give up... I had sworn to eliminate the foul beasts to the last and I wasn't about to let it go. If I was going to stop the thing, I'd have to do it fast.\r\n\r\nI pulled my longbow from my back and nocked my last arrow. I took a deep breath and pulled, trying to keep the cliff racer in my sights. It was literally a longshot with the beast gaining distance and the silt strider bouncing me around at full gallop. Finally, with a silent prayer, I released the string. The arrow sang through the air like a howling demon as it sliced its way towards its target. Finally, just as it crested the lip of a foyada, the arrow struck it in the midsection. It let out a horrible cry and fell out of sight.\r\n\r\nMy cries of triumph were quickly stifled by the sound of over a hundred wings. Rising from the foyada was an entire colony of cliff racers and they were out for blood. The blasted thing had led me right to their nest and sacrificed itself with the intent of feeding me to its brood. It was a trap. The damned things had become much too clever. Knowing this was likely the end, I jumped down from the silt strider and hit the back of its leg with the flat of my glass blade. There was no need for the innocent thing to die here today because of my stupidity. As the ash cloud cleared from being stirred up by its massive legs, the cliff racer brood approached. I held my sword high and prepared for the worst.\r\n\r\nThe battle lasted two full days. I was beaten, clawed, bitten and knocked down more times than I care to remember. In the end, seventy-six cliff racers were slaughtered. I was knee-deep in their corpses and my body on the verge of collapse. But I had survived. I smiled to the heavens and all went black.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke, all I felt was my back on a cold stone floor. Every muscle in my body was on fire, and my vision was blurred. Slowly, I tried to climb to my feet. It took several agonizing minutes, but I finally managed to do it. As my eyes adjusted to the dim light of my new surroundings, I realized that I was standing before Lord Vivec himself. He was simply staring at me... floating above his throne and staring at me with his piercing eyes. When I began to prostrate myself as a sign of respect, he held up one of his hands as if to say it wasn't necessary. Was I dead? Was Lord Vivec pleased with me? Was he about to strike me down in anger for my somewhat sordid past?\r\n\r\nSuddenly I understood everything. Suddenly I realized that I was brought here for a reason. I should have died in those ash wastes, but Lord Vivec must have seen something inside me that he hadn't seen in millennia and decided to spare me from my fate.\r\n\r\nThus began my ascent to Sainthood. Thus began the rise of Jiub!","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n晨風除害英雄暨\r\n丹莫族救星\r\n聖鳩步\r\n的崛起和沒落\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n鳩步  著\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/I_letter.png'>我是獵人。我是救贖者。我是鳩步。\r\n\r\n我的崛起傳奇，可追溯至晨風的荒蕪灰燼。一人一騎，我將武器斜掛身側，焚風侵襲刺痛了面頰。我的任務艱鉅卻無比重要，攸關丹莫人的生死。災禍正悄悄蔓延，在灰燼之境肆虐，這威脅挾帶著永不饜足的饑渴，糾纏那些只想要返家的旅人。我暗自發誓要將牠們一個個自天空擊落。牠們怒不可遏，戰吼震懾大地。牠們是惡名昭彰的峭壁迅鳥，是必除之惡。\r\n\r\n日高月一個特別炎熱的日子，我正在追蹤「徘徊者」，那是我對沒有歸巢的峭壁迅鳥的專有稱呼。牠特別凶猛難纏，讓我在灰燼之丘追了將近三哩遠。先前一次扭打中，我設法傷了牠的一隻翅膀，所以牠並不在最佳狀態，不過依然韌性十足，試圖耗盡我的體力，要我放棄追捕。我們對峙了足足兩個小時，我的闊步沙蚤都累了，但我不能放棄……我曾立下誓言，要殲滅這些邪惡生物，一隻不留，而我還不打算收手。如果我想阻止慘劇繼續發生，就必須速戰速決。\r\n\r\n我抽出揹著的長弓，搭上最後一隻箭。深吸一口氣，我緩緩張弓，視線緊緊跟著峭壁迅鳥。這一箭的射程著實可觀，看似希望渺茫。那頭猛獸不時將距離拉開，而我胯下的闊步沙蚤也全速衝刺，差點沒把我彈落在地。終於，我輕聲祈禱著鬆開弓弦。那支箭像怒吼的惡魔劃過天際，朝目標飛射而去。終於，當猛獸飛到火焰流邊緣頂點之際，飛箭命中牠的腹部。牠發出淒厲的嚎叫，從我的視野中消失。\r\n\r\n但我勝利的歡呼很快就被數以百計翅膀拍擊的聲音給掩蓋。峭壁迅鳥大軍從火焰流振翅而起，流露殺戮的欲望。那隻被我射殺的壞東西刻意把我引到牠們的棲地，然後自我犧牲，而我則是牠送給自家雛鳥的大餐。這是個圈套。這天殺的猛獸居然這麼狡猾。或許我的大限已至。我從闊步沙蚤身上一躍而下，用玻璃岩劍的劍脊打了牠的腿背。這無辜的動物不該因為我的愚蠢而死於非命。牠奔逃離去，灰燼浮雲因其巨大的長腿攪動而飄散，我看到那一窩峭壁迅鳥越來越靠近。我高舉利刃，做好最壞的打算。\r\n\r\n戰鬥持續了兩天兩夜。我飽受痛擊、爪攻、啄咬，還被打倒在地，次數多到無法數算，我也不在乎。最終，共七十六隻峭壁迅鳥死在我的劍下。牠們的屍首疊至我的膝蓋，而我也已搖搖欲墜，幾近崩潰。但我活下來了。我昂首一笑，而後墜入黑暗。\r\n\r\n我醒來時，只感覺到自己躺在冰冷的石地上，全身每一束肌肉都熱如火燒，而且視線模糊。我動作遲緩地試著站起來。雖然這幾分鐘痛苦難熬，但我終於做到了。等眼睛適應陌生環境的幽暗之後，我發現自己正站在維瓦克君主神面前。他目不轉睛地看著我……他飄坐於王位上方，用洞察一切的眼睛看著我。我正準備俯身行禮以表敬意之際，他舉起一隻手，似乎是要我不必多禮。我死了嗎？維瓦克君主神對我的表現滿意嗎？還是他怒不可遏，正打算為我有些汙穢的過去而懲處我？\r\n\r\n突然間，我對一切了然於心。突然間，我知道被帶來這裡自有其道理。我本該死於灰燼荒野，但神主維瓦克想必在我身上看到某種數千年未見的特質，因而決定救我免於既定的命運。\r\n\r\n我因此晉升為聖。鳩步就此復生，寫下傳奇！","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1VQSaintFinalBook","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201A3E8|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Touching the Sky","string":"觸及天空","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1FVBook04English","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"020126C5|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Letter from Harkon","string":"赫岡的信","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1VQ03MalkusNote","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"020192F0|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscovering Ruunvald\r\nVol. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby \r\nMoric Sidrey\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<font face='$HandwrittenFont'>I have decided to document our expedition to find Ruunvald in my journals, with hopes that, should we fail, it will bring illumination to those who follow us.

I've warned him time and time again that his foolish prophecy would cast far too much light on our people and yet he refuses to so much as listen to a word I say. I've become less a wife and more of an annoyance in his eyes. Devoting attention to my work is the only solace I can find while enduring his ridiculous crusade.\r\n\r\n28th Last Seed\r\n\r\nI've had a breakthrough today. I was able to attune the portal vessel to the Soul Cairn properly by using a small sample of ingredients. Although the portal opened only for a few seconds, I'm confident that with the proper formula, it can be sustained indefinitely. I feel like I'm missing a key ingredient, something of sufficient potency that can resist the forces trying to prevent my intrusion. Communing with the Ideal Masters has proved worthless. They speak in riddles and offer no assistance whether I ensure them a steady supply of souls or not. If I'm to escape Harkon's clutches, I need to keep the portal open long enough to carry me away from here... forever if need be.\r\n\r\n3rd Hearthfire\r\n\r\nI've done it! After wasting thousands of gold coins on components, I've discovered how to sustain the portal. I'm listing the components below without the proper amounts for my own protection. As a secondary precaution, I am combining my own blood into the formula which should prevent anyone from being able to duplicate it and following me into the Soul Cairn.\r\n\r\nThe formula consists of:\r\n\r\nFinely ground bone meal\r\nPurified void salt\r\nSoul gem shards\r\n\r\nUsing the proper measurements, place the above in the silver-lined portal vessel and add blood as a reactive agent.\r\n\r\nI will make my way into the Soul Cairn tomorrow after I gather my things and prepare for a potentially lengthy exile. More importantly, I must enact my plans with Serana, and get her to Dimhollow Crypt as soon as possible.\r\n</font>","string":"<p align=\"left\">\r\n<font face=\"$HandwrittenFont\">\r\n末種月27日\r\n\r\n赫岡的短視近利已經成了嚴重的問題。我一再警告，指出他愚蠢的預言將會帶給我們的人民太多無謂希望，但他充耳不聞。與其說是妻子，如今我反倒更像眼中釘。我只能專注於工作，從中尋求一些慰藉，就讓他繼續那可笑的使命吧。\r\n\r\n末種月28日\r\n\r\n今天我有了突破。我成功用少量的材料樣本，把傳送門容器銜接至靈魂石塚。儘管傳送門只開啟幾秒，我確信只要有適當的配方，就能讓傳送門永久敞開。我好像漏了某種關鍵成分，它應該要能和阻擋我侵入的那股力量相抗衡。我已知與理想之主交涉只是枉然，他們話中有話，而且全無協助的意願，即使我承諾將供應穩定的靈魂。如果我想脫離赫岡的控制，就需要確保傳送門的開啟時間長到足以將我送離此地……如有必要，就算是永遠，我也會設法達成。\r\n\r\n爐火月3日\r\n\r\n我成功了！砸下數千枚金幣購買材料，我終於找到能讓傳送門穩定持久的配方。為了自身安全，以下材料並未佐以正確的份量比例。此外，我把自己的血加入配方，作為第二道防線，以防有人複製，隨我前往靈魂石塚。\r\n\r\n配方包含：\r\n\r\n細磨的骨粉\r\n淨化的虛無鹽\r\n靈魂石裂片\r\n\r\n將上述成分以正確份量調配後置於銀邊傳送門容器內，並加入血液作為催化劑。\r\n\r\n明天收拾妥當以後，我就要前往靈魂石塚，開始漫長的流亡。更重要的是，我得和瑟拉娜分享我的計劃，盡快帶她前往暗洞墓穴。\r\n</font>","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1VQ04ValericaBook","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201A3E5|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"The Betrayed","string":"背離之徒","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1FVBook01English","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201957A|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Discovering Ruunvald, Vol. III","string":"探索如瓦德廢墟，卷三","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1RuunvaldJournal04","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201A3E5|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Betrayed\r\n\r\n\r\nby\r\nEngwe Emeloth\r\n\r\n\r\nTranslated from Falmer Text\r\nby\r\nCalcelmo of Markarth\r\n</p>\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/A_letter.png'>nd when the Snow Prince fell to ground,\r\n\r\nThe Ice Elves divided above and below.\r\n\r\nNow vanquished and brutally bound,\r\n\r\nOne moment had shattered all they did know.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>he once cool wind on their skin,\r\n\r\nNow replaced with the heat of the flame.\r\n\r\nAnd a pride once felt deep within,\r\n\r\nForgotten along with their name.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>orn from their home of ice and frost,\r\n\r\nThrown into the pitch black dread of night.\r\n\r\nLiving in fear as their minds become lost,\r\n\r\nAs their eyes begin dimming the light.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/C_letter.png'>hained and enslaved,\r\n\r\nWhat once was light turned to blackness.\r\n\r\nAlone and betrayed, \r\n\r\nSinking deeper into madness.","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n背離之徒\r\n\r\n\r\n英格威．伊枚洛施 \r\n著\r\n\r\n\r\n譯自伐莫文\r\n馬卡斯城的卡塞莫 譯\r\n</p>\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/A_letter.png'>當雪王子捐軀墜地，\r\n\r\n冰精靈分裂為上與下。\r\n\r\n歷經潰敗打擊與殘暴束縛，\r\n\r\n他們曾經熟知的世界在頃刻間粉碎。\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>拂過肌膚的一度是清涼寒風，\r\n\r\n如今已被烈焰高溫取代。\r\n\r\n曾經根深柢固的自傲尊嚴，\r\n\r\n一如他們的名已為人淡忘。\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>自冰霜家園遭連根拔起，\r\n\r\n棄置幽深恐怖的暗夜之中。\r\n\r\n他們茫然失措與恐懼為伍，\r\n\r\n眼眸逐漸朦朧模糊。\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/C_letter.png'>束縛、奴役，\r\n\r\n光明已成黑暗。\r\n\r\n孤寂、背棄，\r\n\r\n默默化為癲狂。","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1FVBook01English","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0200E8D5|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Spell Tome: Necromantic Healing","string":"法術書：死靈治療術","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1SpellTomeNecromanticHealing","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201957C|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Discovering Ruunvald, Vol. IV","string":"探索如瓦德廢墟，卷四","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1RuunvaldJournal05","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201A3E3|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<font face='$FalmerFont'>\r\n\r\nTOUCHING THE SKY\r\nPARMION SALDOR\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</font>\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<font face='$FalmerFont'>\r\nMANY OF THE MOST DEDICATED SNOW ELVES ONCE COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO A TIRELESS JOURNEY THROUGH THE CHANTRY TO THE TEMPLE THEY CARRIED WITH THEM THE PARAMOUNT DESIRE TO BECOME ONE WITH THEIR GOD AURIEL THOUGH ALL SET OUT WITH THE DETERMINATION TO PROVE THEIR WORTH, FEW WERE PREPARED FOR THE TRIALS THAT LAY AHEAD FOR THE PATH TO AURIEL WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS TRIBULATIONS THE PILGRIMS STRUGGLED NOT ONLY AGAINST THE NATURAL ELEMENTS OF THE TREACHEROUS VALE BUT WITH A MYRIAD OF TESTS UPON THEIR FAITH AND LOYALTY\r\n\r\nIT IS TOLD THAT MANY SIMPLY COULD NOT CONTINUE ON THE PATH FOR LONG BEFORE TURNING BACK SOME ARGUE THAT THE REBUKE THEY ENDURED UPON THEIR RETURN WAS CRUELER THAN ANY PUNISHMENT THAT MAY HAVE LAY AHEAD OF THEM ALONG THE PATH.

He had begun teaching me to fight the moment I was able to pick up a blade. Mother had argued that I was too young, but he paid her no mind. I can still remember the elation I felt the first time I bested Father in a match and the look of pride on his face. If it were up to him I know he would have allowed me to join him in battle. With me at his side he may have fared better. Now with Father and so many others slain, the Old Ones claim we are left with too few warriors to continue the fight. I was not the only Young One to speak out in protest, but our small voices went unheard. It has been decided that we must flee to seek help and protection.      \r\n[pagebreak]\r\n8th of Evening Star\r\n\r\nNews has reached us that the great Snow Prince has fallen in battle. The urgency to go into hiding has left many of us scattered and those of us still together unsure of which direction to turn.

May Auri-El guide our footsteps.  \r\n[pagebreak]\r\n13th of Evening Star\r\n\r\nIn the night I overheard the Old Ones whispering secrets of the underground and the Dwemer who dwell there. I thought back on stories Father once told me of these dwarves, heroic tales of honor and glory. The Old Ones must know of these stories for it has been decided that we will change course upon first light. I feel hopeful that the Dwemer will help us to avenge our fallen and reclaim our land.","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n莫提．安果斯的日記\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n譯自伐莫文\r\n馬卡斯城的卡塞莫

I don't think the owner will mind if I take it. I really should spend more time around the docks, these Altmer are too thin blooded for my taste.\r\n\r\nAnyway, one of the tales in the book is an account of the \"Bloodspring of Lengeir's Feast,\" a fabled source of power for vampires. It is a story I've read several renditions of before but this version suggests that it may be located in Skyrim, in a ruin buried by quaking of the earth during the 2nd Era.\r\n\r\nConsidering that my business here with Inquisitor Amolmaire is, shall we say, at an end, it might be a good time to leave Summerset for a worthwhile diversion for the next twenty to thirty years. Perhaps I shall investigate this fabled Bloodspring.\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<b> ~ 2nd of Morning Star, 4E 201</b>\r\n\r\nI was able to obtain passage from Alinor to Solitude by way of ship. No mean feat with this Nord insurrection going on, I assure you. I ran across one of my own in the local tavern and feared at first that it might cause problems for me, but it turns out that she is well-positioned here in the city and has been happy to help if I keep a civil manner. We spoke much on my research into the Bloodspring and while she made sure to point out she thinks it a \"soft headed pursuit\" she did say that what she's heard would point to The Rift.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<b> ~ 5th of First Seed, 4E 201</b>\r\n\r\nAfter months of searching I finally may have found a lead. While looking for a bit of dinner in the Vilemyr Inn, I overheard an old hermit by the name of Jokull, talking about strange red water he found bubbling out of the ground.\r\n\r\nOnce I dispose of this soldier, I'll follow to see if I can find the location.\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<b> ~ 13th of First Seed, 4E 201</b>\r\n\r\nI can't believe I didn't realize sooner.\r\n\r\nJokull has been taking buckets of rock and dirt out of his house all week. When I realized that he's digging a basement I snuck in to check if he had uncovered the Bloodspring. He's hit a cave system that must be where Bloodspring has sunken into over the years. It was hard to see in the dim light, even with my eyes, but I would swear the water I saw pooled on the ground was red.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nUnfortunately he woke up while I was exploring the basement and he dropped his torch on a pelt as I killed him. More setbacks.\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<b> ~ 4th of Rain's Hand, 4E 201</b>\r\n\r\nThe runnels I initially found had passed through too much rock and dirt but I've \"befriended\" some of the locals and we've managed to find the source of the Bloodspring. We've kept a low profile so as not to draw too much attention and thus far I've managed to keep them to only attacking hunters and other dregs, but we'll need to set up a ready food source that won't draw too much attention if we are to remain here.\r\n\r\nThe Bloodspring is not everything that I'd hoped it would be.

The turnkey asks what I'd like for my last meal.\r\n\r\nBring me paper, I say. A quill and a candle.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Jarl would like a confession. I would rather pass the time.\r\n\r\nWhen my father's harem burned down and our family fortune was lost to the ashes, my brother and I set to begging in the gutters of Elsweyr. I will never forget the first time we stole a traveler's purse. It was almost by accident. Just a slip of the claw and the pouch fell into our hands. We ate like kings that night. We slept in a warm bed for the first time in months.\r\n\r\nSoon after, my brother and I took up the knife. The gang we joined treated us as the dirty orphans we were. We robbed, we scammed, we cut and ran and years of debauchery and hard living took their toll. I lost half my left ear in a knife fight with a blind drunk Argonian.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to give up, but my brother, he dreamed bigger, better.\r\n\r\nMy brother wanted to make it to Cyrodiil and become legit merchants. We had a plan.  One final heist of a northbound caravan said to be filled with jewels.\r\n\r\nSomething went wrong. My brother could not stop the horses on time, and I stood helplessly by and watched the wagon plummet over a cliff. But as I picked through the wreckage, my devastation turned to excitement. There were no jewels, but there were plenty of luxurious wolf pelts, horker tusks and mammoth hides, more than enough to buy my way to Cyrodiil. I'd follow in the footsteps of so many of my kind. A traveling merchant, someone with a respectable profession.\r\n\r\nI had all the furs bundled in my pack when I saw my brother's broken body.  His ears were still warm, and I shut his eyes for the last time. This was his dream. And he would want me to go. But what I wanted, well, the caravan guards were coming.  I had to go, but I couldn't just leave his body to rot.\r\n\r\nMy brother gave me my first skin. It was to be a memento. But in the darkness of the fence's cabin, the coin hit my hand heavy. Then she looked at my brother's pelt and offered three times the amount of any other fur. Disgust caught in my throat, but did not live very long. I realized the cost of such a forbidden luxury. The value, the demand, the respect.\r\n\r\nThis is what I wanted.\r\n\r\nIt became easier. A dark alley, a gag in one hand and a quick slice across the throat.  Gently hold the body as it bleeds. I became faster, my cuts precise and fluid. I peel the skin with one motion and kept the merchandise pristine, in one piece.\r\n\r\nI became rich. Far richer than anyone in my family had ever been. Yet I was careful. My stronghold was well-hidden, and practically impenetrable. I hired the men that used to employ me. We moved frequently on less traveled roads when we hunted in the wild. We stalked the back alleys we used to sleep in when we hunted in the city. I grew so rich that I no longer needed to dirty my own hands.\r\n\r\nPatchwork colored furs fetched the best price among the Bosmer. Argonians preferred the pelts completely skinned and tanned. Orcs prized the thick, waterproof leather of the Argonians. Humans most often bought tails and ears. I had to employ an alchemist and a master craftsman for a couple odd requests, but I didn't ask questions when the gold piled up.\r\n\r\nAnd now I'm a prisoner. Maybe I became careless. Maybe I let too many secrets slip between the sheets. The raid of my fortress was a massacre. They took me alive, barely. That was their mistake. My enemies should have killed me when they had the chance.\r\n\r\nI have one lockpick. And the northern wall of my cell is weak from disrepair. My head shall not roll tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI am not finished with the trade. There will always be buyers. Someday, I will sell my own skin for a king's ransom, as my name is legend. And yours shall rot in the gutters with your bones.\r\n\r\n-The Fur Trader","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n虎人毛皮商的自白\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n明天就是我的死期。監獄看守人問我最後一餐想要什麼。\r\n\r\n「給我紙，」我說。「還有羽毛筆跟蠟燭。」\r\n\r\n或許領主會想要一份自白書，但我寧願做點什麼打發時間。\r\n\r\n當我父親的後宮遭祝融焚毀，全家的財產因而付之一炬，我和哥哥流落艾斯維爾省的街頭乞討。我永遠記得我們第一次扒竊一名旅人錢包的情況，那次根本就是碰巧。我們只是輕輕伸出爪子，錢包就落入我們掌中。那一天，我們吃得好豐盛，而且睡在溫暖的床上。我們已經好幾個月沒有這麼舒服地過夜了。\r\n\r\n很快的，我和哥哥開始逞兇鬥狠。我們加入的幫派只把我們當成骯髒的孤兒，確實，那就是我們的身分。我們偷拐搶騙，出手傷人然後逃亡，多年來的放蕩與艱困生活讓我們付出代價。我跟一個酒醉的亞龍人械鬥，因此失去了半個左耳。\r\n\r\n我不想再繼續這樣的生活，但我哥哥卻懷抱更遠大而美好的夢想。\r\n\r\n我哥哥打算前往賽瑞迪爾省，成為合法的商人。我們連計劃都想好了：據說北行的商隊滿載珠寶，只要再大幹最後一票就好。\r\n\r\n可是計劃出了錯。我哥哥無法讓馬匹及時停住，而我只能無助地站在一旁，眼睜睜看著馬車翻落峭壁。當我翻找著殘骸時，內心的悽愴轉為興奮。我沒找到珠寶，但是卻有為數眾多的奢華狼皮、海象牙和長毛象皮，這些足夠我去賽瑞迪爾省好幾趟了。我可以追隨眾多虎人的腳步，成為一名旅行商人，擁有正當的職業。\r\n\r\n正當我忙著把所有毛皮收進行囊時，我看到哥哥支離破碎的軀體。他的耳朵還有餘溫，我伸手替他闔上雙眼，最後一次了。這是他的夢想，他會希望我繼續完成的。不過我想要的是……唉呀，商隊守衛來了，我必須趕緊離開，但我不能留下他的屍體，任其腐爛。\r\n\r\n我的第一張皮，是哥哥捐出來的。那應該是種紀念品。當我在黑暗的銷贓者小屋中，沉甸甸的錢幣落進我的掌心，然後她看著我哥哥的皮，接著出了三倍於其他皮毛的高價。一陣反胃感湧上我的喉嚨，不過時間並不久。我知道在黑市買賣這種非法奢侈品的意義：是價值，是需求，是敬重。\r\n\r\n這才是我要的。\r\n\r\n後來就沒那麼難了。只要找條暗巷，一手掩住口鼻，然後俐落一畫，接著在目標流血時，輕輕托住軀體。我的動作越來越快，下刀精準又流暢。我一個動作皮就掉了，商品毫髮無傷、一體成形。\r\n\r\n財富滾滾而來，我成為家族中前所未有的富豪。但我非常謹慎。我的堡壘據點隱密，而且固若金湯。我聘用以前的僱主。到野外狩獵時，我們只選擇少有人煙的路徑，而且不時變更地點；如果是在城市，則輕手輕腳地在陋巷活動。我後來有錢到不需要親自動手。\r\n\r\n彩色拼接毛皮最受木精靈歡迎；亞龍人喜歡完全去皮且鞣過的生皮；獸人把厚實、防水的亞龍人皮革看作珍品。至於人類，最常購買的則是尾巴和耳朵。雖然我必須雇用鍊金師和技藝高超的工匠，才能迎合某些顧客的特殊要求，但我絕不多嘴，何必把金子往外推呢。\r\n\r\n如今，我是個囚犯。也許是我變得大意了，也許我在翻雲覆雨時不小心洩漏了太多秘密。那次的突襲簡直是大屠殺。我奄奄一息地被他們抓走。這絕對是他們的致命錯誤。我的敵人一定要把握殺死我的機會。\r\n\r\n我有一個開鎖器，而我牢房北面的牆並不堅固。明天，我的頭不會落地。\r\n\r\n我的交易還沒結束。永遠都有買家。有一天，我會出賣我自己的皮，價格將高如國王的贖金，因為我已成傳奇。而你，則會在水溝裡腐爛發臭。\r\n\r\n——毛皮商人\r\n\r\n","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1Book3ValuableFurTrader","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02003F51|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Spell Tome: Sun Fire","string":"法術書：豔陽之火","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1SpellTomeSunFire","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201A3E2|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Unknown Book, Vol. III","string":"未知之書，卷三","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1FVBook03Falmer","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02014017|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Jiub's Opus (Page 8)","string":"聖鳩步的鉅作（第八頁）","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1VQSaintPage08","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0200F39C|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Frenzy Poison Recipe","string":"狂亂毒藥配方","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1RecipeFrenzy1","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02018645|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Darkfall Passage Note II","string":"暗臨通道，筆記二","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC1DarkfallPassageNote02","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02014012|Dawnguard.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face='$HandwrittenFont'><font size='18'>\r\ntracking what I called a Lingerer... a cliff racer without a nest.

Here at last is the breakthrough I have been seeking. All the dangers I have escaped, the traps I have eluded and the foul draugr I have avoided have brought me at last to this.\r\n\r\nIn my previous volume of notes and observations regarding Dimhollow Crypt's possible connections to the ancient vampire clans of Skyrim's history, I wrote of a great chamber, far larger than anything else I've yet seen here in the crypt. \r\n\r\nAlas, a few wandering draugr forced me to retreat to the earlier passages of the crypt, thus depriving me of an opportunity to study this huge cavern.\r\n\r\nWell, praise be to Stendarr, for as I write this, I have just spent nearly a full day exploring that very cavern. \r\n\r\nIt was a risk that proved more than worth it, because what I found in that chamber nearly defies description.\r\n\r\nCentral to this huge cavern is an island of stone in a subterranean lake. Upon this island is something I can only describe as an elaborate ceremonial construction surrounded by stone columns linked by arches. \r\n\r\nThere is no mistaking the stark contrast in architecture here; no ancient Nords made this stonework. Here, too, were more of the gargoyle statues that I first glimpsed in earlier passageways. \r\n\r\nThere is no draugr burial site in Skyrim that contains these statues, save Dimhollow Crypt.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I am now certain that the strange construct in this main chamber was built long after the crypt, and by wholly different masters. These must be the same builders who placed the gargoyles through the crypt, perhaps to frighten away the curious.\r\n\r\nAll signs seem to indicate that the masons who crafted these strange arches were servants of some ancient master who favored necromancy or vampirism. \r\n\r\nThe style and craftsmanship in the stonework are not only distinct in terms of design, seeming to speak of an entirely different culture than that of the old Nord peoples, but also in skill with which they were fashioned. \r\n\r\nThe cutting and shaping of the stone, for example, suggests more sophisticated tools than the crypt's original architects would have possessed.\r\n\r\nAlthough I feel a sense of exhilaration that my theories have at last been confirmed beyond any shadow of a doubt, I am also disappointed at the lack of answers. How long ago were these new features added to the crypt? And by whom? And for what purpose?\r\n\r\nOn one point, I have no doubts.

This verbiage matches no known modern measure of time, and is assumed to be a custom form of counting the days and months. Excavations of ancient Falmer slave quarters have turned up brass vessels, very similar to a deep bowl, with twenty markings crudely etched onto the inside. Falmer scholars theorize that this bowl would be placed under a drip of water coming from an overhanging rock and as the bowl filled, the water's level would reach these markings, thus indicating a crude passage of time. Because of this diary, the vessel has been called a \"kulniir,\" a primitive Falmer timekeeping device.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\nThird Marking, Tenth Kulniir\r\n\r\nIt feels like years since we were forced into hiding. I dare not write where we stay for fear of endangering the good people of this house should this diary be discovered. We have been shown a kindness by this family once known to the Snow Prince. Even in death his great influence has ensured our safety. We were separated from many of our kin along the road when it became increasingly difficult to travel discreetly in our numbers. We were forced to go our separate ways and travel only at night. I have heard no news of where the others may have gone and fear I never shall.

There are moments in my rest when I still hear the laughter of Young Ones at play in the valley. Other times I see the pale flicker of happy moments which were once so common in the land of the Snow Elves. I try not to dwell on these memories too long. Often our surroundings make it impossible to dwell on any happiness. We have been locked together in such close quarters for so long we grow tired of each other's company. Even the strongest of us have faltered with nothing to do but think on what is lost. I wake each day to forlorn faces and am reminded of where we are and all we have left behind. We are all yearning for a day when we can emerge from hiding and walk freely in the light once more. But I fear we are losing all hope that such a day will ever come.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nTenth Marking, Tenth Kulniir\r\n\r\n\r\nI tire of the tears of women and children. My own have run dry.

Yet I cannot force the images of my own losses from my mind. And now in a time when our people should be banding together it feels we are drifting apart. The Nords have truly won. Our once great pride and unity are shattered. If we lose hope now we will never survive. Today many, myself included, have tried to speak out in voices of reason. There can be no hope without talk of our future. We can make no difference if our spirits remain broken.\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nEighteenth Marking, Tenth Kulniir\r\n\r\nWe know that we can never again be the Snow Elves and live freely in this world. We will forever be in hiding in one form or another. But there is no reason we cannot live life with the sun and the wind against our skin.

They carried with them the paramount desire to become one with their god, Auri-El. Though all set out with the determination to prove their worth, few were prepared for the trials that lay ahead. For the path to Auri-El was not without its tribulations. The pilgrims struggled not only against the natural elements of the treacherous vale, but with a myriad of tests upon their faith and loyalty.\r\n\r\nIt is told that many simply could not continue on the path for long before turning back. Some argue that the rebuke they endured upon their return was crueler than any punishment that may have lay ahead of them along the path. In their failed attempt, they were forced to live in the shadow of those who did continue on to achieve the great glory and honor of ascension into the light. Forever after, their faith and loyalty in Auri-El would be scrutinized and their remaining days filled with shame and regret.\r\n\r\nTales of those who reached the Inner Sanctum are not without their share of woes. It is said upon their arrival that many were mere shells of the person they had once been. Some were quite mad from sleeplessness and starved to the point of frailty. By the end of their journey, the marvel that they had strength yet to carry their vessel and ascend the stairs of the temple was the last true testament of their loyalty. Regardless of each individual's tale, the final words remain eerily similar.
