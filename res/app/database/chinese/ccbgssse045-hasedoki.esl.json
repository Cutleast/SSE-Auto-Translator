Rheumy eyes lost their focus as they gazed out over the sun-warmed valley in the mountains of High Rock. For a moment he saw a vision of ancient horrors instead of the fresh greenery of spring. A chill washed over his aged bones.\r\n\r\n\"Is this a suitable topic for the young and innocent?\" he asked himself. The young must be taught, but must they learn of such things now, when they should be playing in the sunlight? This is a tale for the dreary winter, with the wind howling outside a walled town and the doors and windows closed and bolted against the blast and cold and -- other things.\r\n\r\nHe glanced with affection at his two grandchildren: the little towheaded boy with a hint of mischief dancing in his eyes even on those rare occasions when sitting quietly, and his older sister. A serene lass, the old man thought. Her hair like a dark flame and her slightly pointed ears were the only obvious signs of elven blood. So like her grandmother, the old man thought. The past is past, and I'shira had brought him so much peace and happiness after a lifetime of battle. He forced his thoughts back to the present.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, children. I was remembering things. Old people do that, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to tell us the story of Jagar Tharn and the Emperor and the Eternal Champion?\" His grandson asked. \"That's my favorite!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly, son. They were a part of it, in a way. As are I'ric and Moraelyn and Edward and Reymon and many others. Even the gods play a part. This is a far older story, and even the priests won't tell it my way. They have their own interpretations, and their fears as well. I'm too old and have seen too much to have any fear left, except that our people will forget. And forgetting is dangerous. So I, and a few others, carry this tale and try to spread it among the younger generations. You aren't really old enough to understand it all, but I can feel that my end is not far off. I must ask you to remember anyway. In a few years, perhaps, if I still live, we can discuss it again. If not, well, you must seek out others who know, and compare notes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You talk as if you are going to die, Granther,\" his granddaughter spoke up. \"That can't happen. You will live forever!\"\r\n\r\nChuckling, \"I'm afraid not, dear. But I have a little while left, enough for the story\".\r\n\r\nThe children settled back against the bole of a large oak, knowing that the old man could not be hurried. Leaning forward, he began:\r\n\r\n\"Long, long ago, before there were any people at all; even before the gods, Tamriel was chosen as a battleground by two -- things. It is difficult to find words that fit them well. I call them the Light and the Dark. Others use different names. Good and Evil, Bird and Serpent, Order and Chaos. None of these names really apply. It suffices that they are opposites, and totally antithetical. Neither is really good or evil, as we know the words. They are immortal since they do not really live, but they do exist. Even the gods and their daedric enemies are pale reflections of the eternal conflict between them. It's as though their struggle creates energies that distort their surroundings, and those energies are so powerful that life can appear, like an eddy in a stream.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do demons and trolls come from the Dark, Grandpa?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly, son. The undead evils we know, and the demons that live on Oblivion tend to align with the Dark. Their natures are more akin to it. Humans and the other peoples of Tamriel, even the misunderstood Dark Elves, are more aligned with the Light. Our evils are not always of the Dark, but some are, and these are the truly dangerous ones. Jagar Tharn was almost wholly aligned with the Dark, and that is really why he was so monstrous. It was not because he was a black mage, as some would have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did his magic come from the Dark, Granther?\" The girl's interest was piqued by mention of magic. Her heritage is beginning to show itself, thought the old man.\r\n\r\n\"No, magic power comes directly from the energies swirling about both entities. These energies are impersonal and all mixed up. Black magic is more a matter of intent than effect. The Mages' Guild holds that a fireball, say, directed against a creature intent on causing harm, is not black magic; but the same spell directed at one seeking peace is. In this, they are right. Destruction of a fire daedra strengthens the Light and weakens the Dark just a little. In the same manner, destruction of a unicorn strengthens the Dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the gods? Do they come from the Light?\" The boy's eyes were animated, but tinged with apprehension. He adored stories of the gods and goddesses of Tamriel's pantheon, and the heroes who served them.\r\n\r\nThe old man chuckled. \"The gods have an unusual origin, if some of the oldest tales are true. The oldest inhabitants of this world -- no one seems to be sure what race they were -- had a system of myths that they believed in for a thousand years. The people of et'Ada believed for so long and so well, that their beliefs may, just may, have drawn upon the energies surrounding Tamriel to bring the gods themselves into being. If that is so, the conflict between the Light and the Dark provided the energy, and the et'Adans the structure, that created the gods of Tamriel. No one really knows since it was so long ago and so little survives from that time. It no longer matters; the gods have their own existence now, and mostly align with the Light, except for a few who are, shall we say, a little ambiguous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do we have to remember, Granther? What is the danger you spoke of? If the Light and Dark are so big and powerful, can we influence them? Should we try? What should we fight for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that your critical faculties are developing, Solara. That is good. The answer is simple, but quite large enough for mere mortals like us. The Light and Dark are evenly matched, and perhaps will never resolve their conflict. Mortals and the beings of the Aetherius sometimes can perceive traces of them. Therein lies the danger; to most of us the Light is more congenial, even inspiring, and moves us to behavior that we would call good. To creatures like us, the Dark is -- horrible. Those who have visions of it are often driven mad, and the ones who are not would be better dead. The Dark is to us a monstrous emptiness, an emptiness that sucks the soul toward it -- to be twisted, maimed, and ultimately destroyed. What we can see of it seems utterly evil. Perhaps somewhere else this would not be so, but in our world, it is.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man paused to gather his thoughts, gazing once more at the fresh new life of spring. \"What we must do is never to forget that the Dark is always there, beckoning to the weak-souled among us. Should it gain ascendancy over Tamriel, through agents perverted by its awful attraction, terrible things could happen. All that we hold beautiful or desirable, even love itself, would be swept away. Peace and hope would be no more. For Tamriel, that would be the worst possible disaster. What I saw during Jagar's reign nearly killed me, almost destroyed my mind. When he was destroyed, I thought the worst was over, but it was not. The forces of the Dark are on the march again, and new heroes must rise to join the Eternal Champion in the fight against them.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man and the two children sat in silence for several minutes. Finally, the children assisted their grandfather to his feet, and they walked slowly away. Toward home, and hearth, and lunch.\r\n", "form_id": "05000804|ccbgssse045-hasedoki.esl", "type": "BOOK DESC", "editor_id": "ccBGSSSE045_BookTheLightandtheDark", "string": "[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n光明與黑暗\r\n\r\n\r\n作者：\r\n伊瑞克．昂特格\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n「是的，孩子，泰姆瑞爾大陸又稱『競技場』，並非空穴來風。」坐在巨岩上的老人稍微調整了姿勢，並順了順他的灰色長袍。老人在高岩省的山區眺望陽光直射的山谷，因此雙眼混濁失焦。照理來說，映入他眼簾的應該要是春意盎然的翠綠景色，但他一瞬間彷彿看到了來自遠古的恐怖之物。\r\n\r\n他問自己：「這個主題適合說給天真無邪的孩子聽嗎？」年輕人是必然要學習的，但他們這年紀還應該在陽光下玩耍，真的該這麼早就知道這種東西的存在嗎？這種故事應該在寒冬說才對，在高牆環繞的城鎮裡頭，窗戶緊閉，將寒風抵擋在外......還有其他東西。\r\n\r\n他帶著愛意看向兩個孫兒：其中一個金髮小童難得坐得穩，但是眼神依然調皮，他的姊姊則坐在旁邊。老人心想，這姑娘還真是穩重。她的頭髮是深暗的火焰色，稍微有點尖的雙耳是唯一能看出精靈血脈的地方。老人心想，她跟祖母真是太像了。過去的都過去了，戰鬥了一輩子之過，伊什拉已經帶給他許多和平與幸福。他把思緒拉回了現在。\r\n\r\n「抱歉，孩子，我想到以前的一些事。老人家嘛，難免。」\r\n\r\n他的孫子問：「你要告訴我們賈加．薩恩、皇帝和永恆英雄的故事嗎？我最愛聽了！」\r\n\r\n「不太算，孩子，但說起來也有點相關。就像伊力克、莫拉雷因、愛德華、雷蒙和其他人一樣。就連天神也是其中一部分。這個故事要來得久遠許多，就連祭司說的角度也跟我不一樣，他們有自己的詮釋，也有自己害怕的地方。我年紀太大了，看過的東西太多，已經沒什麼好怕了，唯一怕的是我們的族人會忘記過去。忘記過去是很危險的事。所以我和幾個人試圖將這個故事口耳相傳，告訴年輕一代。你們年紀還太小，可能沒辦法了解整個故事，但我感覺得到我在世上的日子不久了。我還是得要你們記住這個故事。要是我過幾年還活著，我們可以在把故事拿出來聊聊。如果沒有，你們要去找其他知道這個故事的人，相互比對故事內容。」\r\n\r\n他的孫女說：「你說得好像你要死了一樣，爺爺。不行！你要永遠活下去！」\r\n\r\n他輕笑著說：「恐怕沒辦法，小乖，但我還有點時間，能把這故事說完。」\r\n\r\n孩子們往後靠著大橡樹的樹幹，心裡很清楚催老人沒有用。老人向前傾，開始說起故事：\r\n\r\n「很久很久以前，世上還沒有任何人類，甚至連天神都沒有，泰姆瑞爾被兩個......「東西」選為戰場，我實在找不到言語形容他們，只能叫他們光明和黑暗。其他人可能會用不同的名字稱呼：善良與邪惡、鳥與蟒蛇、秩序與混亂。這些名字其實都沒那麼貼切，總之知道他們是相對的兩方就夠了。沒有一方是我們認知中的正義或邪惡。他們不算真的活著，僅僅只是存在，但也是永生不死。就連天神與敵對的魔族也只是他們之間永恆鬥爭的影子。就好像他們的爭鬥創造出能扭曲周遭的能量，而且這股能量大到能讓生命從中而生，就像溪中的渦流一般。」\r\n\r\n「爺爺，惡魔和巨魔是從黑暗中來的嗎？」\r\n\r\n「不算是，孩子。我們知道的不死邪惡生物以及住在湮滅領域的惡魔，通常會和黑暗站在同一邊。他們的天性比較接近黑暗。人類和其他泰姆瑞爾大陸上的其他人，包括遭到誤解的暗精靈，都和光明站在同一邊。我們的邪惡生物並不是全然從黑暗而生，但有些確實是，那些才是真正危險的東西。賈加．薩恩幾乎完全認同黑暗，所以他才是如此醜陋的怪物，而非有些人所想的因為他是黑色法師。」\r\n\r\n「爺爺，他的魔法是來自於黑暗嗎？」小女孩一聽到魔法耳朵就張大了。老人心想，她的精靈血脈開始顯現出來了。\r\n\r\n「不，魔法的力量直接來自兩個存在體的能量漩渦。這些能量不具人格、完全混在一起。黑魔法是由使用者的意圖定義，而非其效果。法師公會認為，要是火球術是要攻擊試圖搗亂的生物，那就不算黑魔法，但要是同樣的法術攻擊了愛好和平的生物，那就算黑魔法。這點他們是對的。火焰魔族的毀滅能稍微強化光明，削弱了黑暗。同樣地，獨角獸的毀滅會強化黑暗。」\r\n\r\n「那天神呢？他們是從光明而生的嗎？」小男孩的眼睛亮了起來，但還是帶有一絲恐懼。他很喜歡聽泰姆瑞爾萬神殿的男女天神，和服侍眾神的英雄故事。\r\n\r\n老人笑著說：「要是古老故事沒錯，眾神的起源很不尋常。這世界最早的居住者......雖然不知道他們是什麼種族，自有一套神話系統，並奉為圭臬數千年的時間。原靈人相信已久，他們的信仰也許來自泰姆瑞爾周圍的能量，因此讓天神得以存在。若這是事實，光明與黑暗的衝突提供了能量，原靈提供結構，創造出了泰姆瑞爾的天神。沒人知道事實究竟為何，畢竟這是遠古時代的事，而且幾乎沒人從那時候活到現在。這都不重要了，天神們現在都有其存在，大半都認同光明，除了幾個曖昧不明的之外。」\r\n\r\n「爺爺，我們為什麼要記得這個故事？你說的危險又是什麼？如果光明和黑暗這麼強大，我們能影響他們嗎？有必要嘗試嗎？我們又要為何而戰？」\r\n\r\n「看來你的思辯能力精進了，索拉拉。很好。答案很簡單，但超乎我們常人的理解能力。光明與黑暗勢均力敵，而且他們的衝突也許永遠無法解決。凡人與艾瑟瑞斯的生物有時可以感覺到他們的蹤跡，但這也是危險所在。我們大半人都認同光明，甚至能從他得到啟發，往我們口中的善良行徑靠攏。對我們這種生物來說，黑暗相當可怕。能看到黑暗的人，經常已經失去理智，即便沒有失去理智，還是死了比較好。對我們來說，黑暗是可怕的空虛，會將靈魂吸進去，扭曲、支解、最終毀滅。我們看到的黑暗似乎完全都是邪惡的。也許在其他地方並非如此，但在我們的世界是這樣沒錯。」\r\n\r\n老人安靜下來沉思，雙眼再次看向心聲的春天枝芽。「我們千萬不能忘記黑暗永遠都在，呼喚著靈魂弱小的生命。要是黑暗試圖扭曲其代理人的心智，並藉此掌控泰姆瑞爾，可怕的事就會發生。我們眼中美麗的、可愛的事物，就連愛本身，都會不復存在。和平與希望會消失，這對泰姆瑞爾來說會是最可怕的災難。我在賈加統治期間的見聞差點讓我丟了小命，幾乎使我失去理智。他失勢後，我以為谷底已經過去，但卻並非如此。黑暗的勢力再次站了起來，新的英雄必須加入永恆英雄的陣營，與他們戰鬥。」\r\n\r\n老人和兩個孩子安靜地坐著，持續了好幾分鐘。最後，孩子們把爺爺扶了起來，慢慢離開。回到他們溫暖的家，享用午餐。\r\n"}, {"original": "Smuggler's Trade Notes", "form_id": "05000802|ccbgssse045-hasedoki.esl", "type": "BOOK FULL", "editor_id": "ccBGSSSE045_SmugglerNote", "string": "走私者的交易筆記"}, {"original": "<font face='$HandwrittenFont'>\r\nThe new source has been a real boon.

What is that for? Is it powerful?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's powerful,\" the Orc replied, \"In fact, it once belonged to the wizard Hasedoki, a great mage who is said to have no equal.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he had no equal, then what killed him?\"\r\n\r\nThe Orc glanced briefly at the staff's head, as if waiting for Hasedoki himself to speak. Yet its countenance remained stuck in that playful stare, halfway between laughter and mockery. She would have to respond in his place.\r\n\r\nUfkul Gilgar had spent the last ten years contemplating the same question before settling on her answer. Throughout much of that time, her life had mirrored Hasedoki's, traveling the world in search of one who could challenge her. It was custom that bequeathed her the staff, and destiny that made her wield it. But even with fate beside her, the staff provided little comfort, knowing the ending it designed.\r\n\r\n\"There's only one thing that could kill a wizard as powerful as Hasedoki,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Is it a cliff racer? A magic sword? The undead?\" \r\n\r\n\"Time.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke from experience. Time grew the day with emptiness and yet made all things seem fleeting. So long as it passed, contentment would morph into boredom, and love would fade into loneliness. \r\n\r\nAs a necromancer, she had the tools to defy death. She had no similar solution for life. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the mortals had already divined an answer. For them it was not magic, but children who allowed them to delay time's inexorable march. Now that she was a mother, the loneliness no longer consumed her, even though that too was  temporary. And just as the staff was passed on to her by her father, when the time came, she would do the same for her son. It may have been why Hasedoki bound his soul to the staff, so that his spirit would be one with whoever wielded it.\r\n\r\nUkful placed the staff in the child's hands and watched as he scuttled through the tomb, swinging it around like a blunt instrument. It's possible the boy would be free of the same curse, the boredom that plagued his ancestors and Hasedoki before them. Morrowind was home to a great many wizards. Somewhere in that group was a worthy challenger.\r\n\r\nAnd if not, there would still be time for the next child.", "form_id": "05000839|ccbgssse045-hasedoki.esl", "type": "BOOK DESC", "editor_id": "ccBGSSSE045_BookToRaisetheLiving", "string": "[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n喚醒活人\r\n\r\n\r\n沙格拉布．吉爾加\r\n著\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n「為什麼要住在墳墓裡面？」\r\n\r\n孩子輕輕拉了拉獸人的斗蓬，想要問出答案。\r\n\r\n「就像皇帝身邊有刀鋒衛士一樣，我們身邊也要有死者。」\r\n\r\n「那法杖呢？是幹嘛用的？很強大嗎？」\r\n\r\n獸人回答：「很強大，這法杖以前的主人是傳說中無人能敵的法師哈塞朵其。」\r\n\r\n「如果他無人能敵，那他是被什麼殺死的？」\r\n\r\n獸人瞥了法杖的頭一眼，彷彿在等待哈塞朵其自己回答。但法杖的頭還是維持耐人玩味的表情，像是在笑，又像在嘲諷。她得代他回答了。\r\n\r\n巫芙庫爾．吉爾加過去十年都在思考這個問題，最後總算給了自己一個答案。這段期間，她模仿哈塞朵其，大半時間都在周遊各地，尋找能夠挑戰她的人。這個習慣透過法杖傳給了她，法杖落到她的手中是命運的安排。但即使命運與她同行，她對自己的下場心知肚明，有了法杖也沒什麼慰藉。\r\n\r\n她回答：「只有一個東西能夠殺死哈塞朵其這樣強大的法師。」\r\n\r\n「是峭壁鳥？魔法劍？還是不死生物？」\r\n\r\n「時間。」\r\n\r\n她憑著自己的經驗說出這個回答。經過越久時間，日子也越來越空虛，但一切彷彿稍縱即逝。隨著時間過去，自滿變成無趣，愛會褪成孤單。\r\n\r\n身為死靈術士，她有能抵抗死亡的工具，但她卻對生命沒輒。\r\n\r\n也許凡人已經占卜出了個答案。對他們來說解答並非魔法，而是孩童，讓他們延遲時間的無情的腳步。現在她成了母親，雖然只是暫時的，她不再會被孤單吞噬。就如同她父親把法杖傳給她一樣，時間到了，她也會把法杖傳給她的兒子。也許正是因為這個原因，哈塞朵其才會把自己的靈魂依附在法杖上，他的靈魂才能永遠跟法杖持有者同在。\r\n\r\n巫芙庫爾把法杖擺在孩子的雙手上，看著他在墳墓之間揮舞，彷彿把法杖當成鈍器一般。也許這孩子不會受到相同的詛咒，不會像他的祖先和哈塞朵其一樣被無聊擊敗。晨風住著許多偉大的法師，裡頭總會有能通過挑戰的傢伙。\r\n\r\n即便沒有，下一個孩子還會有時間的。"}, {"original": "Smuggler's Ledger", "form_id": "05000803|ccbgssse045-hasedoki.esl", "type": "BOOK FULL", "editor_id": "ccBGSSSE045_SmugglerLedger", "string": "走私者的帳本"}, {"original": "<font face='$HandwrittenFont'> \r\n\r\nItems:\r\nDozen bottles of skooma\r\n\r\nDelivered to: \r\nDelvin Mallory, Riften\r\n\r\nSmuggler's Fee: \r\nFifty septims and a favor.
