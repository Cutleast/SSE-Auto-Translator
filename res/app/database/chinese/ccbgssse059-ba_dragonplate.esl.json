At first, I didn't understand it. We were already making good coin sacking the carriages. What was the point of digging holes underground like vermin? It didn't help that the tunnel smelled like a troll's armpit.\r\n\r\nWe reached the warehouse, and walked by crates stacked upon crates like mountains of wood. M'Sharra led me to the back, where a dozen Legionnaires were unloading cargo too big for any box. And Shor's Breath, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it! It was a skull the size of a carriage, with fangs that touched the floor! \r\n\r\nFor someone who winces at the sight of cliff racers, the idea of this monstrosity soaring through the sky made my heart tremble. And yet, for the first time, I felt alive.\r\n\r\nFor what better way to live than to fight a dragon! What better way to die! Now that would be a story even Tsun would lend an ear to!\r\n\r\n\"You think the bones are special, you should see what this one found yesterday,\" M'Sharra said to me. Her grin was as wide as the Halls of Jorrvaskr as she beckoned me further into the warehouse. Inside a crate, set apart from the others, was a cuirass of Dragonbone Mail! M'Sharra bade me to put it on, and I couldn't help but notice it was a perfect fit.\r\n\r\nIn that moment, I thought of my Da. People called him a pirate, a murderer and a thief. But he told me the Wind-Striders descended from the Dragonguard, ancient warriors who fashioned armor from the bones of the dragons they slew. \r\n\r\nStill, my pride as a Nord wouldn't allow it. How could I face Tsun wearing the armor of another's triumph? I could have the Orc forge gauntlets and boots from the skull, but the cuirass - that which held one's heart, must be earned in battle. \r\n\r\nMy mind drifted then to stories I heard as a youngling, of my great ancestor who strode through fire like it was the wind, wearing an ancient cuirass made of dragonbone. It was then that I knew my destiny. In his honor I would claim it, and fight until the day I reached Sovngarde. \r\n\r\nIt's that same spirit that resides in me now. The others may be fine living in hiding, but a Nord is at war so long as he holds breath.", "form_id": "0500081B|ccbgssse059-ba_dragonplate.esl", "type": "BOOK DESC", "editor_id": "ccBGSSSE059_BjormundNote", "string": "<font face=\"$HandwrittenFont\">\r\n我還清楚記得姆夏拉第一次帶我去看地道那天，就是我們一連挖了好幾個月的那條地道。起初我不是很懂，我們打劫那些馬車就已經賺進大把的金錢，為什麼還要像土裡的蟲子一樣鑽地洞？而且那地道還臭得要命，把巨魔的狐臭都令人絕望。\r\n\r\n我們挖通了地道，成功進入了倉庫，走過層層堆疊的木箱，一箱又一箱堆成了一座山。姆夏拉帶我到倉庫後面，看到十幾個帝國軍團士兵正在卸貨，那東西大到沒有任何箱子裝得下。朔爾之息啊！我真不敢相信我的眼睛！那竟然是一個跟馬車一樣大的顱骨，嘴上的尖牙長到碰到地板！\r\n\r\n我是一個看到峭壁迅鳥都會受驚的人，一想到如此龐然巨獸遨翔空中，我整顆心都在顫抖。但於此同時，我也感到自己真正活著，這是我有生一來第一次產生這樣的感覺。\r\n\r\n想像一下與這樣的一隻巨龍搏鬥！還有什麼比這更能證明自己活者！還有什麼更好的死法！如此可歌可泣的篇章，就連蘇恩都要側耳傾聽！\r\n\r\n「光這些骸骨就讓你震驚成這樣嗎？那你最好看看我昨天發現什麼。」姆夏拉對我說。她招手邀我繼續走進倉庫的深處，臉上的笑容比勇士之家宏偉的廳堂還要寬廣。我們來到一個獨立陳放的箱子前，裡面竟然裝著一件龍骨鏈甲胸甲！姆夏拉要我穿上，我赫然發現胸甲竟然完美貼合我的身體。\r\n\r\n那一刻，我想起了爸。在世人眼裡，他是一名海盜、殺人凶手、小偷，但他跟我說過，我們風行者家族是神龍衛的後裔，先祖們是上古的戰士，會獵殺巨龍並用牠們的骨頭製作護甲。\r\n\r\n但想到此處，我身為諾德人的尊嚴卻不容許我穿上這胸甲了。我若穿上他人奮鬥得來的戰利品，怎麼還有顏面佇立在蘇恩面前呢？我可以請我們那位獸人用那顱骨打造腕甲或靴子，但守護心臟的胸甲......必須親手在戰鬥中贏得。\r\n\r\n我的心思飄盪，想到那些兒時聽聞的傳說，想到那名偉大的祖先如何披戴古老的龍骨胸甲，踏過烈焰如履疾風。那一刻，我明白了自己的使命，我將以一顆榮耀他的心拿走這件胸甲，誓死戰鬥直到抵達英靈殿的那一天。\r\n\r\n如今，我心中仍充滿這份心志，或許其他人安於到處躲躲藏藏，但我們諾德人只要一息尚存，戰鬥就永不止息。"}, {"original": "Guard's Dossier: Bjormund Wind-Strider", "form_id": "05000819|ccbgssse059-ba_dragonplate.esl", "type": "BOOK FULL", "editor_id": "ccBGSSSE059_BjormundDossier", "string": "衛兵檔案：貝約蒙德．風行者"}, {"original": "<font face='$HandwrittenFont'>\r\nStatus: Active (Capture or Kill), High Priority\r\n\r\nDescription: Male, Nord, late 50s\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nReferred to by locals as the \"Dragon of Dawnstar,\" Bjormund is the son of a former pirate who frequented the northern port.
