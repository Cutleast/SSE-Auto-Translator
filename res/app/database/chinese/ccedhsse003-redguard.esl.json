Weltan is a Redguard poet whose verse I had read, but only in translation. He chooses to write in the old language of the Redguards, not in Tamrielic. I once asked him why.\r\n<br>\r\n    \"The Tamrielic word for the divinely rich child of rot, silky, pressed sour milk is... cheese,\" said Weltan, a huge smile spreading like a tide over his lampblack face. \"The Old Redguard word for it is mluo. Tell me, if you were a poet fluent in both languages, which word would you use?\"\r\n<br>\r\n    I am a child of the cities, and I would tell him tales of the noise and corruption, wild nights and energy, culture and decadence. He listened with awed appreciation of the city of my birth: white-marbled Imperial City where all the citizenry are convinced of their importance because of the proximity of the Emperor and the lustration of the streets. They say that a beggar on the boulevards of the Imperial City is a man living in a palace. Over spiced ale, I regaled Weltan with descriptions of the swarming marketplace of Riverhold; of dark, brooding Mournhold; of the mold-encrusted villas of Lilmoth; the wonderful, dangerous alleys of Helstrom; the stately avenues of grand old Solitude. For all this, he marvelled, inquired, and commented.\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I feel as if I know your home, the Alik'r Desert, from your poems even though I've never been there.\" I told him.\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Oh, but you don't. No poem can express the Alik'r. It may prepare you for a visit far better than the best guide book can. But if you want to know Tamriel and be a true citizen of the planet, you must go and feel the desert yourself.\"\r\n<br>\r\n    It took me a little over a year to break off engagements, save money (my greatest challenge), and leave the urban life for the Alik'r Desert. I brought several books of Weltan's poems as my travel guide.\r\n<br>\r\n    \"A sacred flame rises above the fire, The ghosts of great men and women without names, Cities long dead rise and fall in the flame, The Dioscori Song of Revelation, Bursting walls and deathless rock, Fiery sand that heals and destroys.\"\r\n<br>\r\n    These first six lines from my friend's \"On the Immortality of Dust\" prepared me for my first image of the Alik'r Desert, though they hardly do it justice. My poor pen cannot duplicate the severity, grandeur, ephemera and permanence of the Alik'r.\r\n<br>\r\n    All the principalities and boundaries the nations have placed on the land dissolve under the moving sand in the desert. I could never tell if I was in Antiphyllos or Bergama, and few of the inhabitants could tell me. For them, and so it came to me, we were simply in the Alik'r. No. We are part of the Alik'r. That is closer to the philosophy of the desert people.\r\n<br>\r\n    I saw the sacred flame of which Weltan wrote on my first morning in the desert: a vast, red mist that seemed to come from the deep mystery of Tamriel. Long before the noon sun, the mist had disappeared. Then I saw the cities of Weltan. The ruins of the Alik'r rise from the sand by one blast of the unbounded wind and are covered by the next. Nothing in the desert lasts, but nothing dies forever.\r\n<br>\r\n    At daylight, I hid myself in tents, and thought about the central character of the Redguards that would cause them to adopt this savage, eternal land. They are warriors by nature. As a group, there are none better. Nothing for them has worth unless they have struggled for it. No one fought them for the desert, but the Alik'r is a great foe. The battle goes on. It is a war without rancor, a holy war in the sense the phrase should always imply.\r\n<br>\r\n    By night, I could contemplate the land itself in its relative serenity. But the serenity was superficial. The stones themselves burned with a heat and a light that comes not from the sun, nor the moons Jone and Jode. The power of the stones comes from the beat of the heart of Tamriel itself.\r\n<br>\r\n    Two years I spent in the Alik'r.\r\n<br>\r\n    As write this, I am back in Sentinel. We are at war with the kingdom of Daggerfall for the possession of a grass-covered rock that belongs to the water of the Iliac Bay. All my fellow poets, writers, and artists are despondent for the greed and pride that brought these people into battle. It is a low point, a tragedy. In the words of Old Redguard, an ajcea, a spiral down.\r\n<br>\r\n    Yet, I cannot be sorrowful. In the years I spent in the glories of the Alik'r, I have seen the eternal stones that live on while men go dead. I have found my inner eye in the tractless, formless, changeless and changeable land. Inspiration and hope, like the stones of the desert, are eternal though men be not.\r\n<br>", "form_id": "0200083D|ccedhsse003-redguard.esl", "type": "BOOK DESC", "editor_id": "ccEDHSSE003_Book_TheAlikr", "string": "[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n阿里喀爾\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n作者\r\n恩瑞克．米爾內斯\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n要不是我在哨兵城一間小酒館遇到威爾坦，我大概永遠不會到阿里喀爾沙漠。威爾坦是一位紅衛人詩人，我以前讀過他的作品，不過是譯文。他選擇用紅衛人的古老語言寫作，不用泰姆瑞爾語。我曾經問過他為什麼。\r\n<br>\r\n    威爾坦露出大大的笑容，像潮水一般漫過他的黝黑臉龐。他說：「牛奶酸掉、腐敗凝結後壓成塊狀，能夠成就餘韻無窮的美味食物。這種食物泰姆瑞爾語叫做乳酪，紅衛人的古老語言叫做穆羅。你告訴我，如果你是精通這兩種語言的詩人，會選擇用哪一個詞？」\r\n<br>\r\n    我是城市的孩子，我會告訴他城市的喧鬧與糜爛，狂野的夜晚，城市的活力、文化與腐敗。我說到我出生的城市，他總是聽得入神：滿是白色大理石的帝都，市民們的自傲無可動搖，因為他們離皇帝如此接近，他們的街道如此光亮。有句話說，即使是帝都街道上的乞丐，也算是居住在皇宮之中。我與威爾坦喝著香料酒，我跟他描述河之城萬頭攢動的市場；哀傷之城的黑暗與悲悽；里爾莫斯長滿黴菌的莊園；赫爾斯壯充滿樂趣與危險的小巷；壯觀的獨孤城肅穆的大道。他聽到這一切，總是嘖嘖稱奇、不斷與我分享問題與意見。\r\n<br>\r\n    我告訴他：「雖然我沒有到過你的家鄉阿里喀爾沙漠，但是閱讀你的詩篇，彷彿也已經很熟悉了。」\r\n<br>\r\n    「啊，不是這樣的。再怎麼好的詩，也沒有辦法讓人真正認識阿里喀爾沙漠。要做足去那裡的準備，讀詩要比讀旅遊書好多了。但是你想要真正了解泰姆瑞爾、真正成為這個星球的公民，一定要親自去體會沙漠。\r\n<br>\r\n    我花了超過一年的時間，處理各種雜事、存夠錢（這是最大的難處），讓我離開城市生活，前往阿里喀爾沙漠。我帶了好幾本威爾坦的詩集，當作我的嚮導。\r\n<br>\r\n    「火堆升起神聖之焰，是無名偉人的鬼魂。消逝已久的城市，在火焰中重新興衰。迪歐斯科的啟示之歌，爆裂的牆垣與永恆的岩石，賦予生命也賦予死亡的火熱之沙。」\r\n<br>\r\n    這是我朋友的作品〈沙塵之永恆〉前六行，讓我見到阿里喀爾沙漠的第一眼前，心中已經有大略的印象，但這幾句詩怎麼可能傳達沙漠的全貌。我這枝筆，怎麼寫都寫不出阿里喀爾的嚴苛與壯麗、剎那與永恆。\r\n<br>\r\n    國家在這片土地上所畫出的區域與邊界，在滾滾的沙漠之下只有淹沒一途。我從來不知道自己是在安提非羅斯還是伯加瑪，沙漠的居民也沒有幾個人說得出來。我也逐漸習慣了他們的觀點：我們在阿里喀爾。不對，該說我們是阿里喀爾的一部分，這才比較接近沙漠居民的想法。\r\n<br>\r\n    我在沙漠的第一個早晨，就看見了威爾坦筆下的神聖之焰：一片廣大的紅色煙霧，彷彿是從泰姆瑞爾深處的秘密湧升出來的。日正當中前，煙霧早就消散，這時我看見了威爾坦筆下的城市。風吹過一望無際的大地時，也會吹散覆蓋阿里喀爾遺跡的沙塵。沙漠中沒有永遠的生，但也沒有永遠的死。\r\n<br>\r\n    在白天，我躲在帳篷中，思考紅衛人是什麼樣的核心性格，讓他們居住在這片野蠻的永恆大地。他們是天生的戰士，沒有任何一群人打得過他們。對他們來說，沒有經過奮鬥爭取的事物就沒有價值。雖然沒有人跟他們爭這片沙漠，但阿里喀爾本身就是偉大的敵人。這場戰爭還在進行，是一場沒有仇恨的戰爭，是名符其實的聖戰。\r\n<br>\r\n    到了夜晚，我可以凝視相對靜謐的大地，但是靜謐只是表象。地上的石頭仍然發出光與熱，不是來自太陽、也不是來自兩個月亮裘妮或裘德。石頭所發出的力量，來自泰姆瑞爾跳動的心臟。\r\n<br>\r\n    我在阿里喀爾沙漠待了兩年。\r\n<br>\r\n    寫作本文時，我已經回到了哨兵城。我們與匕首雨王國陷入戰爭，爭取一塊長滿草的石頭，其真正的歸屬該是伊利亞克灣。其他詩人、作家與藝術家都怨嘆著讓人們陷入征戰的貪婪與自大，認為這是一次衰落、一場悲劇。用紅衛人的古老語言說，就是「艾希亞」，向下沉淪。\r\n<br>\r\n    但是我悲傷不起來。我居住在壯麗的阿里喀爾那兩年，看見了人死後仍然永遠存續的石頭。我在這片無垠無形、不變又萬變的大地上，找到了內心之眼。人總有一死，但是精神與希望跟沙漠中的岩石一樣，永遠存續。\r\n<br>"}, {"original": "The Ebon Arm", "form_id": "020008D3|ccedhsse003-redguard.esl", "type": "BOOK FULL", "editor_id": "ccEDHSSE003_BookTheEbonArm", "string": "黑檀之臂"}, {"original": "[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ebon Arm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby\r\nWitten Rol\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>he ground shakes. The great armies continue to wage their unrelenting battle. The battlefield is red, the rivers flow crimson, the sky reflects a deep pink. In the distance lightning flashes, and thunder sounds. Two huge ravens begin circling the field; their blackness is vibrant against the various shades of red in this vista of death and suffering. The bright lashes of light and rumbling begin to increase. The redness surrounding the battlefield begins giving way to a golden glow from the east, almost like a summer's setting sun. From the false sunset a massive golden stallion and single rider approach. All become suddenly still on the field of battle as both sides recognize Reymon Ebonarm, God of War, and the companion and protector of all warriors, also known as the Black Knight and his mighty steed War Master.\r\n<br>\r\n    He rides into the middle of the blood soaked field and dismounts. He is a very imposing figure. His very tall and heavily muscled body is encased in ebony armor. His ebony helmet does not hide the flowing reddish blonde hair and beard which appear almost as shimmering gold, nor does it shield the steel blue eyes that seem to pierce all they fall upon. In his left hand he carries a massive ebony tower shield on which is emblazoned a fiery red rose. As he raises his right arm, all see an arm and a magnificent ebony blade which are extensions of each other. The fused arm and sword are a result and symbol of the wounds suffered by this god during titanic battles in the youth of this world.\r\n<br>\r\n    The ravens come to rest on his shoulders. And, as the point of the ebony blade seemingly touches the sky, lightning flashes, thunder roars. Then total quiet descends and a shudder rolls through both armies.\r\n<br>\r\n    The leaders of both armies approach Reymon Ebonarm and kneel. In turn they tell their reasons for this war. Each asks for the favor of the Black Knight for their cause. Reymon Ebonarm listens, but there is no acknowledgment that he has chosen to favor one side or the other in this fight. However, each of the leaders has heard the other state his position. And, each now knows that this war is baseless. They embrace and turn to their armies. They instruct their forces to bury their dead, tend their wounded and return to their homes.\r\n<br>\r\n    Reymon Ebonarm mounts his great golden stallion, War Master, and again raises the ebony blade skyward and extends the huge rose emblazoned ebony shield to both armies. A massive chorus of cheers rises from the armies. The ravens again take to the air. Lightning and thunder follow him as he rides into the sunset followed by the two birds.\r\n<br>\r\n    The armies do as they have been bidden. They care for their wounded and bury their dead. As they retreat towards their homes each warrior is sure that the great God Reymon Ebonarm, the Black Knight, has responded to their individual prayers for intervention. Each side has won, neither has lost.\r\n<br>\r\n    As the armies depart the field, the rivers begin to run clear, and a single red rose begins to bloom near the grave of a fallen hero.\r\n<br>", "form_id": "020008D3|ccedhsse003-redguard.esl", "type": "BOOK DESC", "editor_id": "ccEDHSSE003_BookTheEbonArm", "string": "[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n黑檀之臂\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n作者\r\n惠坦．羅爾\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n天搖地動，雙方大軍戰鬥毫無停歇。戰場地面染紅，血流成河，連天空也反射一片紅光。遠方有閃電一亮、雷聲巨響，兩隻大烏鴉在戰場上盤旋，黑色的軀體對照戰場上死亡與痛苦的一片紅，顯得十分鮮明。雷電的光與聲越來越大，戰場的紅開始消散，金色的光芒從東方照耀，彷彿是夏日的夕陽。從這偽日落中，走出一名戰士，騎著巨大的金色公馬。戰場突然靜了下來，因為雙方都知道來者是雷蒙．黑檀臂，他是戰爭之神、所有戰士的同伴與守護者，又稱黑色騎士，他的神駒則是戰爭大師。\r\n<br>\r\n    騎士走到濺血的戰場中央，下了馬。他的氣勢震懾各方，身材高聳魁梧、肌肉賁張，全身上下都有黑檀岩護甲覆蓋。他的黑檀岩頭盔遮不住飄逸的金紅長髮與鬍子，彷彿是閃耀的黃金，也擋不住那鋒利的藍色雙眼，能看穿視線所及的一切。他的左手拿著巨大的黑檀岩塔盾，上面有著火紅色的薔薇紋飾。他舉起右手時，全部的人都看見他的手臂與壯美的黑檀岩長劍合而為一，互為延伸，這是傷痕也是象徵，代表著戰神參與世界初生時的大戰所承受的傷勢。\r\n<br>\r\n    烏鴉停在他的肩膀上。他的黑檀岩劍鋒彷彿刺上了天，雷電大作。然後是一陣完全的靜默，戰場雙方都不禁顫抖。\r\n<br>\r\n    雙方部隊的領袖來到雷蒙．黑檀臂面前跪下，輪流交代參戰的理由，各自懇求黑色騎士支持自己的一方。雷蒙．黑檀臂傾聽兩造說法，但毫無跡象顯示他會偏向任何一方。然而，兩位領袖都聽到了對方的立場，兩位現在都知道這場戰爭毫無理由。他們擁抱，然後轉身對部隊發號施令。他們命令部隊安葬死者、照顧傷者，回到各自的家園。\r\n<br>\r\n    雷蒙．黑檀臂騎上他的金色神駒戰爭大師，再次高舉黑檀岩劍，向雙方部隊伸出他那帶著薔薇紋飾的黑檀岩盾牌。雙方部隊歡聲雷動。烏鴉再次飛上天際。雷蒙朝著夕陽前進，兩隻烏鴉與雷電相隨。\r\n<br>\r\n    雙方部隊都遵守命令，照顧傷者、安葬死者。在返家的路途上，每一位戰士都深信偉大的戰神、黑色騎士雷蒙．黑檀臂，是因為自己的祈求而介入這場戰事。雙方都獲得勝利，沒有一方落敗。\r\n<br>\r\n    雙方部隊離開戰場時，河流重新清澈了，一名陣王英雄的墳前，有一朵紅色薔薇開始綻放。\r\n<br>"}, {"original": "Fijeh's Letter to <Alias=Player>", "form_id": "02000814|ccedhsse003-redguard.esl", "type": "BOOK FULL", "editor_id": "ccEDHSSE003_FijehLetterPersuasion", "string": "費傑致<Alias=Player>的信"}, {"original": "<font face=\"$HandwrittenFont\"><font size='16'>\r\n<Alias=Player>,\r\n\r\n    I've been watching your exploits for some time.
