They say that some of the miners broke through the wall in shaft three of Raven Rock Mine and found some ruins. I hope this isn't another waste of time like that fiasco they sent me to in Cyrodiil. I'll gather my assistant, Millius and sail back to Raven Rock at first light... it'll be nice to see the old house in Solstheim again.\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/DLC02GratianBoat.png' width='300' height='257'>\r\n7 Second Seed 4E10\r\n\r\nFinally arrived in Raven Rock and was surprised at the number of dark elf refugees living in town. They aren't really from mining stock, but I think they'll make fine workers one day. Millius and I spent a good part of the day clearing the ash off of the roof of my house. The damn volcano is still erupting almost day and night. If it wasn't for the ash covering everything it would almost look beautiful.\r\n\r\n8 Second Seed 4E10\r\n\r\nMillius and I are headed into Raven Rock Mine to have look at whatever it is the miners uncovered. I think I'll stop by the old Swing and Scoop and pick up a few supplies before we head down. Couldn't hurt to be prepared.\r\n\r\n9 Second Seed 4E10\r\n\r\nLooks like the miners broke right through the wall of an old Nordic barrow. I've seen this sort of thing in Skyrim before... damn Nords have barrows dotting the landscape and almost none of them are ever marked on any maps. Looks like this barrow belong to something called the \"Bloodskal Clan.\" I'm going to take some rubbings of the inscriptions on the tombs and see if I can't learn some more information from my history books.\r\n\r\n10 Second Seed 4E10\r\n\r\nIt's been a few days and I can't find even a single mention of this clan anywhere. Millius and I decided to proceed ahead. We've come to a dropdown point, but I can see a massive chamber below. Took the better part of a day to lower everything down and climb down the almost sheer drop.\r\n\r\n11 Second Seed 4E10\r\n\r\nIt's been an astonishing day of discovery! After exploring the large chamber beyond the dropoff, I was startled to find the strangest weapon I've ever laid eyes upon sitting on a pedestal of sorts. The blade appears to be flawless, and is emitting a faint chilling glow. Bits of parchment I found about the chamber seem to call this \"The Bloodskal Blade.\" Not certain if I should remove it yet, I think I'll sleep on it.\r\n<p align='center'>\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/DLC02GratianSword.png' width='200' height='260'>\r\n</p>\r\n<p align='left'>\r\n12 Second Seed 4E10\r\n\r\nI've decided against my own better judgment to remove the Bloodskal Blade from its pedestal. Millius seems completely against it, but we need to bring this wondrous artifact with us when we find a way out of the barrow.\r\n\r\n13 Second Seed 4E10\r\n\r\nI should have listened to Millius. The moment the blade was lifted, we were set upon by draugr. Millius fought bravely, but he fell. I was able to destroy the remaining ones, but I was badly wounded. I can barely stand. My only chance would be finding a way out of this place, but I fear that I'm trapped.\r\n\r\n14? Second Seed 4E10\r\n\r\nExploring has been slow. I can only move for maybe a few minutes at a time before I have to rest. My supplies are running low, and I'm feeling weaker by the hour. The only progress I've made is finding a strange door with markings on it that I've never seen. \r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/DLC02GratianDoor.png' width='300' height='260'>\r\nThere appears to be something to them I'm missing, as they've confounded my attempts at getting through. I'll have to study this further in order to make any progress... barely can keep awake.\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/DLC02GratianSlash.png' width='250' height='250'>\r\nI'm fairly certain that the key to the door involves the use of the Bloodskal Blade. When swinging the weapon, I'm noticing a ribbon of mystical energy emanating from it. I think by swinging the sword in different directions, it's possible to manipulate this ribbon and solve whatever puzzle this door presents. I hope to get well enough to put this to the test soon... each swing is a huge effort.\r\n\r\nLast entry\r\n\r\nI've lost track of time and my strength is fading. I can't even stand anymore. My wounds refuse to heal. I'm afraid this tomb will become my resting place. If anyone finds this journal, please send these notes to my superiors at the East Empire Company and tell my wife that I love her.\r\n\r\nMay Arkay guide me to my final rest.\r\n</p>\r\n</font>","string":"<font face=\"$HandwrittenFont\">\r\n\r\n第四紀元10年，雨手月30日\r\n\r\n今天收到一封東帝國貿易公司寄來的信。他們說有礦工鑿穿了鴉石礦場三號礦井的牆，發現了某些廢墟。希望這次不會跟上回賽瑞迪爾省一樣，只是浪費時間的鬧劇。\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/DLC02GratianBoat.png' width='300' height='257'>\r\n我會帶著助手秘里烏思，明天天一亮就揚帆返回鴉石……能再見到索瑟海姆的老家，還是挺好的。\r\n\r\n第四紀元10年，次種月7日 \r\n\r\n我們終於到鴉石鎮了，居然有這麼多暗精靈難民住在這裡，著實讓我很意外。雖然他們對採礦不甚了解，但我想他們應該可以成為不錯的採礦工人。秘里烏斯和我花了大半天清除我家屋頂上的灰燼。那座該死的火山幾乎日夜都很活躍。要不是灰燼覆蓋了大半個城市，那景象看來倒是蠻漂亮的。\r\n\r\n第四紀元10年，次種月8日\r\n\r\n秘里烏斯和我要前往鴉石礦場，看看那些礦工到底找到什麼。我想在路上先去「又揮又挖」一趟，買些補給用品，有備無患總是好事。\r\n\r\n第四紀元10年，次種月9日\r\n\r\n看來礦工直接撞進一處古老的諾德古墳了。我曾經在天際省看過這類廢墟……可惡的諾德人在各地都有古墳，而且幾乎全都不在地圖上。這座古墳看來屬於「血吟氏族」。我要拓下一些墓碑上的銘文，看看能否從我的歷史書中得到更多資訊。\r\n\r\n第四紀元10年，次種月10日\r\n\r\n已經過了好幾天，但我還是找不到任何和這支氏族有關的隻字片語。秘里烏斯和我決定繼續追查。我們前往一個可以下去的地點，我可以看到下方有個巨大的空間。我們把握時間，把所有東西都放下去，然後爬下這個近乎垂直的投物口。\r\n\r\n第四紀元10年，次種月11日\r\n\r\n今天有了大發現！好好探索投物口下方的大房間之後，我很驚奇地發現一個前所未見的古怪武器，端放在某個類似台座的東西上。刀身看來完美無瑕，散發出微微的寒光。我找到的少量羊皮紙文件好像稱這武器為「血吟刃」。還不確定我應不應該移動它，我想我會再考慮一下。\r\n<p align='center'>\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/DLC02GratianSword.png' width='200' height='260'>\r\n</p>\r\n<p align='left'>\r\n第四紀元10年，次種月12日\r\n\r\n我決定忽視我的理智，把血吟刃從台座上移開。秘里烏斯看來完全不贊成，不過我們一定要把這奇妙的工藝品帶出去。\r\n\r\n第四紀元10年，次種月13日\r\n\r\n我應該聽秘里烏斯的話。才一動刀刃，我們就被諾德亡靈襲擊。秘里烏斯勇敢抵抗，但失敗了。我設法打倒了其他亡靈，不過卻深受重傷，幾乎無法站立。除非找到離開這裡的方法，否則穩死無疑，但我似乎被困住了。\r\n\r\n第四紀元10年，次種月14日？\r\n\r\n找尋出路的進度遲緩。我每次只能行動大概幾分鐘，然後就得暫停。我的補給物資所剩無幾，我感覺自己越來越虛弱。我的唯一進展是找到一扇門，上面有某些我從沒看過的記號。\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/DLC02GratianDoor.png' width='300' height='260'>\r\n我想必是遺漏了什麼，它們儼然是我脫身的絆腳石。我必須進一步研究，才可能有新的發現……好難保持清醒。\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/DLC02GratianSlash.png' width='250' height='250'>\r\n我相當確定要開啟這扇門，就必須使用血吟刃。揮動武器的時候，我注意到有股神秘的能量從內部發散而出。我想藉由朝不同方向揮動武器，或許就能利用這股能量，解開這扇門的謎題。希望我能夠稍微恢復一點氣力，才能快點試試我的推論……每揮一次血吟刃都無比費力。\r\n\r\n末段\r\n\r\n我已經搞不清楚時間，我的體力正在衰竭。現在根本站不起來了。我的傷完全沒有起色。我好怕這座墳墓會成為我的長眠之地。如果有人找到這份日誌，請將這些筆記送至我在東帝國貿易公司的長官，並告訴我妻子我愛她。\r\n\r\n願阿爾凱帶領我至安息之處。\r\n</p>\r\n</font>","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2RR03GratiansJournal","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02016E22|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face=\"$HandwrittenFont\">\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\nWaking Dreams of A Starless Sky\r\n\r\nby Bilius Felcrex\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>he eyes, once bleached by falling stars of utmost revelation, will forever see the faint insight drawn by the overwhelming question, as only the True Enquiry shapes the edge of thought.

A quiet and reserved man who never drank, never visited a brothel or even uttered a curse, he was famous for his ability to make people disappear. Once a person was targeted by the Brotherhood and Torik was sent to them, they would simply cease to be. I asked him once what his weapon of choice was, and was equally startled by his answer.\r\n \r\n\"I only likes to use axes,\" he said in his typical, quiet voice.\r\n \r\nThe image of this silent, dour fellow attacking anyone with a weapon as inherently bloody and violent as an axe so frightened and intrigued me that I questioned him about it further. This is an inherently dangerous activity, for assassins are not typically keen to give out their stories. Torik did not mind the questions, though it took some time to get the full story out of him, as naturally shy and reserved as he was.\r\n \r\nIt seemed that Torik had been orphaned as a very young age and sent to live with his uncle, a saltrice plantation owner in Sheogorad in northern Vvardenfell. The man promised to show his nephew the business and eventually make him a partner when he was old enough. In the meantime, the boy was put to work as his uncle's house servant.\r\n \r\nIt was a grueling life as the old man was very particular about how things should be done. The boy was first required to give all the floors in the house a thorough scouring, from the attic to the cellar. Whenever the floor was not cleaned to the uncle's satisfaction, which was frequent, Torik was thrashed and forced to begin again.\r\n \r\nThe boy's second duty was to ring the bell that would bring the laborers into the house. This was done at least four times a day, once for each meal, but if his uncle had any news or additional instructions for the laborers - which he frequently did - the bell might need to be sounded a dozen times or more. It was a huge iron bell in the tower and the boy quickly discovered that he had to throw his entire body into the motion of pulling the chain in order to have it sound loud enough to bring everyone in from the field. If he was tired and did not pull the backbreaking chain hard enough, his uncle was soon at his side to beat him until he rang the bell loud and clear.\r\n \r\nTorik's third task was dusting all the shelves in his uncle's vast library. As deep and old as the shelves were, he was required to work with a long, heavy duster on a rod. The only way that he could reach to the back of the shelves was to hold the duster at his shoulder and then swing it out in a sweeping motion. Again, if the uncle saw any dust left over or felt that the boy was not working as hard as he ought to, the punishment was swift and severe.\r\n \r\nAfter several years, Minas Torik grew into a young man, but his job responsibilities were not increased. His uncle promised to teach him the business, once Torik had demonstrated his mastery of his servile assignments. Divorced from any knowledge of any work other than his own, Torik never knew how badly in debt his uncle was and how poorly the farm's yield was.\r\n \r\nIn his eighteenth year, Torik was called into the cellar by his uncle. He thought that he had not done a good enough job scouring the floor down there, and was frightened of the beating to come. What he found, however, was his uncle packing his goods into crates.\r\n \r\n\"I'm leaving Morrowind,\" he explained. \"The business has gone sour, so I thought I'd try my luck running a caravan in Skyrim. I understand there's good money to be made, trading fake Dwemer artifacts to the Nords and Cyrodiils. I wish I could take you with me, my lad, but there won't be much need for scouring, bell pulling, and dusting where I'm going.\"\r\n \r\n\"But uncle,\" said Torik. \"I can't read, I knows nothing of the business you promised to teach me. What wills I dos on my own?\"\r\n \r\n\"I'm certain you can find a job in some domestic capacity,\" shrugged the uncle. \"I've done my best with you.\"\r\n \r\nTorik had never stood up to his uncle before, and felt no anger only a sort of coldness that gripped his heart. Among his uncle's possessions being packed away was an old heavy iron axe, allegedly of Dwemer manufacture. He picked it up in his hands and was surprised to find that it was not much heavier than his dusting rod. In fact, it felt very comfortable as he pulled it over his shoulder and swung it out as he had done so many times before. In this instance, however, he swung it into his uncle's right arm.\r\n \r\nThe old man screamed with pain and rage, but for some reason, Torik didn't feel frightened anymore. He propped the axe against his other shoulder, and swung it out again. It cut a swath across the old man's chest and he fell to the floor.\r\n \r\nTorik hesitated before lifting the axe above his head. It was another natural position for him, like he was ringing a bell. Over and over again, he swung down as if he was calling the laborers in from the field. Except that this time, there was no sound except for a wet thump, and no laborers came in from the field. Of course, his uncle had sent them away hours before.\r\n \r\nAfter a time, there was nothing left of his uncle that couldn't be washed down the cellar drain. The process of cleaning up came easily to Torik as well. Blood scrubbed up much quicker than the usual grime and saltrice flour that littered the cellar floor.\r\n \r\nIt was well known that Torik's uncle was planning to leave Morrowind, so his disappearance provoked no suspicion. The house and all the belongings were sold to the debt collectors, but Torik took the axe. It seemed that his uncle had given him some worthwhile business skills after all.","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n使斧人\r\n \r\n使斧高手另類手冊\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/O_letter.png'>密納斯．托力客是跟我談過話的魔拉格堂成員中，最讓我困惑的一位。他安靜而內斂，從不喝酒也從不上妓院，甚至不曾咒罵，而他最著名的就是讓人消失的能力。一旦被兄弟會當成目標，而托力客恰好是執行者，那些人就立刻不再是目標。我曾問他選用什麼武器，他的答案同樣讓我大吃一驚。\r\n\r\n「我只愛用斧頭，」他以慣常的平靜聲音回答。\r\n\r\n這個沉默陰鬱的男人揮舞本質上如此血腥暴力的武器攻擊人的畫面，讓我無比驚駭，我不禁繼續發問。這樣的訪問其實相當危險，因為刺客一般而言並不愛說自己的故事。托力客不介意這些問題，但因為他的害羞與寡言，我也花了不少時間才問出故事全貌。\r\n\r\n托力客很小的時候就成了孤兒，被送去瓦登費爾北方和種植撒翠私的叔叔同住。叔叔答應帶領姪子認識他的事業，並在他長大後讓他成為合夥人。然而，叔叔卻把男孩當成了自家的僕人。\r\n\r\n因為叔叔對任何事情該如何進行自有一套不容更動的作法，男孩的生活疲累難熬。他先要求男孩每天必須把從閣樓到地窖、整棟屋子的地板徹底擦洗一遍，如果地板的乾淨程度達不到叔叔的標準（通常都達不到），托力客就會挨打，而且必須重擦一次。\r\n\r\n男孩的第二份工作是敲鐘，通知在大農場工作的工人返回屋裡。每天最少要敲四次，一餐一次，但要是叔叔有事情要宣布或有新指示下達（次數非常頻繁），就必須敲十幾次或更多。那是一座掛在塔樓裡的巨大鐵鐘，男孩很快就發現自己必須跳起來、用盡全身的力氣才有辦法拉動鍊條，敲出即使在田裡也能聽到的響亮鐘聲。如果他太累，鍊條拉得不夠遠，他的叔叔就立刻現身，一直打他，直到他敲出清楚又響亮的鐘聲。\r\n\r\n托力客的第三份工作是清除叔叔寬敞圖書館所有書架的灰塵。因為書架又深又舊，他必須使用又長又重的除塵桿。為了去除書架深處的灰塵，他必須把除塵桿舉到肩膀上揮出去。叔叔如果發現書架有任何灰塵，或者他認為男孩工作不夠賣力，嚴厲的懲罰立刻降臨。\r\n\r\n幾年之後，密納斯．托力客已經長大，但他的工作職務還是一樣。叔叔保證只要托力客完美做好他的僕役工作，就要教他經營事業。因為除了自己的職務，托力客對其他工作全無涉獵，他完全不知道叔叔的債務問題嚴重，而農場營運也是一片慘澹。\r\n\r\n托力客十八歲的時候，叔叔叫他到地窖去。他以為是那裡的地板沒擦乾淨，非常害怕即將面臨的責打。沒想到，他卻見到叔叔正在收拾，把東西放進板條箱裡。\r\n\r\n「我要離開晨風省，」叔叔解釋。「農場生意慘澹，我想碰碰運氣，去天際省經營篷車隊。我知道賣假的鍛莫工藝品給諾德人和賽瑞迪爾人，頗有賺頭。我希望能帶你一起去，可是我要去的地方沒有地板好擦、沒有大鐘要敲，也沒有灰塵要撢。」\r\n\r\n「可是，叔叔，」托力客說。「我不識字，對你所說要教我的事業一無所知。我一個人要怎麼活？」 \r\n\r\n「我相信你一定能找到一些家務方面的雜活，」叔叔聳聳肩。「我對你仁至義盡了。」 \r\n\r\n托力客從未挺身面對叔叔，他也不覺得生氣，只是有股冷漠揪住他的心。他叔叔打包起來的家當裡，有把據說出自鍛莫人之手的沉重舊鐵斧。他拿起斧頭，驚訝地發現它的重量跟他的除塵桿相差無幾。事實上，把這斧頭扛在肩上、再用力一揮，感覺非常自在，跟他以前做過無數次的除塵動作一模一樣。就在這一刻，他將斧頭砍入叔叔的右手臂。\r\n\r\n老人又痛又怒地尖叫，可是不知為何，托力客再也不怕了。他把斧頭換到另一邊的肩膀，再度揮擊。斧頭劃過老人的胸膛，令他跌倒在地。\r\n\r\n托力客遲疑了一下，然後把斧頭高舉過頭。他覺得這個姿勢也很熟悉，跟拉鍊條敲鐘很像。一次又一次，他揮動斧頭，彷彿從田地召喚工人回來。只不過這次沒有鐘聲，而是一種濕潤的重擊聲，而且沒有任何工人從田裡趕過來。畢竟他的叔叔已在幾小時之前，要他們全部離開了。\r\n\r\n一段時間之後，他叔叔就被擦抹得乾乾淨淨，全部沖進地窖的排水道。清理對托力客而言也是輕而易舉的小事。刷洗血跡甚至比清除地窖地板上常見的髒汙和撒翠私粉快速得多。 \r\n\r\n因為人人皆知托力客的叔叔打算離開晨風省，因此他的失蹤並未啟人疑竇。那棟房子和所有東西全都賣給了討債人，但托力客留下那把斧頭。看來他叔叔畢竟還是教了他一些經營事業的技能。","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book2CommonTheAxeMan","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"020331C2|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Cultists' Orders","string":"教徒的命令","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2CultistOrders","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02027496|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Recipe - Glowing Spider","string":"配方 - 光蜘蛛","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2ExpSpiderCrftBookGlowing","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02036600|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Letter from Ralis Sedarys 2","string":"雷利思．賽得瑞的來信 2","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2dunKolbjornCourierNote02","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02031CC8|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face=\"$HandwrittenFont\">\r\nLook Meryn I'm not arguing that these towers are falling to pieces, but I think you are exaggerating about the planks falling ou--------\r\n\r\n\r\n","string":"<font face=\"$HandwrittenFont\">\r\n默林，你聽好，我同意這些塔樓快散了，但我覺得你有些誇大其辭，地板明明就很堅","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2dunBloodskalNote01","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02026D41|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK CNAM","original":"Sapphire + Salt Pile + Albino Spider Pod","string":"藍寶石 + 鹽堆 + 白化蜘蛛卵囊","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2ExpSpiderCrftBookFrostCloak","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201CE07|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face'$HandwrittenFont'><font size='40'><p align='center'>\r\nBound Dagger","string":"<font face'$HandwrittenFont'><font size='40'><p align='center'>\r\n束縛匕首","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2SpellTomeBoundDagger","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"020177B5|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face'$HandwrittenFont'><font size='40'><p align='center'>\r\nAsh Rune","string":"<font face'$HandwrittenFont'><font size='40'><p align='center'>\r\n灰燼符文","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2SpellTomeAshRune","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"020177BD|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Spell Tome: Frenzy Rune","string":"法術書：狂亂符文","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2SpellTomeFrenzyRune","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02028FAF|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Hrodulf's Journal","string":"賀多夫的日記","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2HrodulfJournal","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"020374D6|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face=\"$HandwrittenFont\">\r\nI am closer to solving the mystery of these ruins!

It is possible nobody has opened this gate since the days of the Dwemer!

These Daedra Lords rebelled against the counsel and admonition of the Tribunal, causing great kinstrife and confusion among the clans and Great Houses.\r\n\r\nMalacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, and Sheogorath are holy in that they serve the role of obstacles during the Testing. Through time they have sometimes become associated with local enemies, like the Nords, Akaviri, or Mountain Orcs.\r\n\r\nMalacath is the reanimated dung that was Trinimac, Malacath is a weak but vengeful god. The Dark Elves say he is Malak, the god-king of the orcs. He tests the Dunmer for physical weakness.\r\n\r\nMolag Bal is, in Morrowind, the King of Rape. He tries to upset the bloodlines of Houses and otherwise ruin the Dunmer gene pool. A race of monsters, said to live in Molag Amur, are the result of his seduction of Vivec during the previous era.\r\n\r\nSheogorath is the King of Madness. He always tests the Dunmer for mental weakness. In many legends he is called upon by one Dunmer faction against another; in half of these stories he does not betray those who called him, further confusing the issue of his place in the scheme of things (can he help us? is he not an obstacle?). He is often associated with the fear other races have of the Dunmer, especially those who, like the Empire, might prove as useful allies.\r\n\r\nMehrunes Dagon is the god of destruction. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. To some he represents the inhospitable land of Morrowind. He tests the Dunmer will to survive and persevere.\r\n\r\nThe worship of these four malevolent spirits is against the law and practice of the Temple. However, the Four Corners seldom fail to discover those greedy, reckless, or mad enough to serve them. By ancient Temple law and custom, and also by imperial law, the lives of witches and warlocks are forfeit, and Imperial garrisons join Ordinators and Buoyant Armigers of the Temple in tracking down and destroying these foul covens in the wilderness refuges and ancient ruins where they conceal their profane worships.\r\n</p>","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n動亂之屋\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/A_letter.png'>隨聖梅洛特和奇莫人進入應許之地晨風省的祖靈之中，四位魔族王侯：瑪拉凱斯、梅魯涅斯．大袞、莫拉格．巴爾和謝爾格拉，被稱為「動亂之屋四樁腳」。這四位魔族王侯罔顧裁決者的勸誡和警告，在各氏族和豪族之間造成內部衝突和騷動。\r\n\r\n瑪拉凱斯、梅魯涅斯．大袞、莫拉格．巴爾和謝爾格拉之所以成為神祇，是因為他們在「大考驗」期間，擔任障礙的角色。不過他們有時也與例如諾德人、阿卡維爾人或山地獸人等當地敵人為伍。\r\n\r\n瑪拉凱斯是崔尼馬克死後從他已腐化的靈魂和身體復活，是個軟弱但報復心很強的神祇。暗精靈說他是獸人的神王瑪拉克。他考驗丹莫人的體能弱點。\r\n\r\n在晨風省，莫拉格．巴爾是強暴之王。他試圖顛覆王族血統，並毀壞丹莫人的基因庫。一支據說住在莫拉格雅姆爾的怪獸族，就是他在上一紀元引誘維瓦克的成果。\r\n\r\n謝爾格拉是瘋狂之王。他考驗丹莫人的心理弱點。在許多傳說中，一支丹莫派系召喚他與另一幫人對抗；這些故事中有一半說他並未背叛那些呼求他的人，這進一步模糊了他在整件事情中所扮演的角色（他能幫助我們嗎？他會不會反成阻礙？）。他常跟外族（尤其那些或許有利於己的同盟，例如帝國）對丹莫人的恐懼一起出現。\r\n\r\n梅魯涅斯．大袞是毀滅之神。他和自然界的危險如大火、地震和洪水密不可分。對有些人而言，他代表了晨風省的冷漠大地。他考驗丹莫人的生存意志是否堅強不屈。\r\n\r\n崇拜這四個惡質神靈違反神殿的律法和宗旨。然而，這四枝樁腳從不乏貪婪、魯莽或痴狂之人服侍。依照上古神殿律法和慣例，以及帝國法律，女巫與術士的生命必須被摧毀，帝國駐軍連同晨風省常備軍以及神殿衛隊常到他們舉行瀆神之崇拜儀式的曠野與古廢墟掃蕩。\r\n</p>","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book2CommonHouseofTroubles","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0202826B|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\nNerevar at Red Mountain \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>he following is from the Apographa, the hidden writings of the Tribunal Temple. It is a scholarly retelling of a tradition transmitted through the Ashlanders concerning the battle at Red Mountain and subsequent events. The Ashlanders associate this tale with the telling of Alandro Sul, a shield-companion of Nerevar who came to live among the Ashlanders after the death of Nerevar and during the ascension of the Tribunal. There are many variant treatments of this story, but the primary elements are consistent throughout the tradition. The murder of Nerevar, the tragic fate of Dagoth Ur, and the profane source of the Tribunal's divine power are denied by Temple doctrine as ignorant Ashlander superstition, and not widely known among civilized Dunmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n Resdayn, present day Morrowind, was contested ground between two very different types of mer: the Chimer, who worshipped Daedra, and the Dwemer, who worshipped a profane and secret power. These two people warred with each other constantly until their lands were invaded by a young, vibrant, and violent alien culture, the Nords.\r\n \r\n\r\nTwo heroes, one from the Chimer and one from the Dwemer, Indoril Nerevar and Dumac Dwarf-Orc, made peace between their people and together ousted the alien invaders. Then these two heroes worked long and hard to maintain that peace thereafter, though their counselors thought it could not last or, worse, that it shouldn't. Nerevar's queen and his generals-- Almalexia, Sotha Sil, Vivec-- told him to claim all Resdayn for his own. But Nerevar would not listen, for he remembered his friendship with Dumac. There would be only peace.\r\n \r\n\r\nUntil Dagoth-Ur arrived. House Dagoth had discovered the source of the profane and secret power of the Dwemer: the legendary Heart of Lorkhan, which Dumac's people had used to make themselves immortal and beyond the measure of the gods. In fact, one of the their high priests, Kagrenac, was building a New God so that the Dwemer could claim Resdayn for their own.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Tribunal urged Nerevar again to make war on the Dwarves. Nerevar was troubled. He went to Dumac, his friend of old, and asked if what Dagoth-Ur said was true. But Kagrenac and the high priests of the Dwemer had kept their New God secret from their King, and Dumac said the Dwemer were innocent of any wrongdoing. Nerevar was troubled again and made pilgrimage to Holamayan, the sacred temple of Azura, who confirmed that all that Dagoth-Ur said was indeed true and that the New God of the Dwemer should be destroyed for the safety of not only Resdayn, but for the whole world. When Nerevar went back and told his Tribunal what the goddess had said, his queen and generals felt themselves proved aright and again counseled him to war. There were reasons that the Dwemer and Chimer had hated each other forever.\r\n \r\n\r\nFinally, Nerevar, angered that his friend Dumac would lie to him, went back to Vvardenfell. This time the Chimer King was arrayed in arms and armor and had his hosts around him, and he spoke harshly to Dumac Dwarf-Orc, King of Red Mountain. \"You must give up your worship of the Heart of Lorkhan or I shall forget our friendship and the deeds that were accomplished in its name!\" And Dumac, who still knew nothing of Kagrenac's New God, but proud and protective as ever of his people, said, \"We shall not relinquish that which has been our way for years beyond reckoning, just as the Chimer will not relinquish their ties to the Lords and Ladies of Oblivion. And to come at my door in this way, arrayed in arms and armor and with your hosts around you, tells me you have already forgotten our friendship. Stand down, my sweet Nerevar, or I swear by the fifteen-and-one golden tones I shall kill you and all your people.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nAnd so the Chimer and Dwemer went to war. The Dwemer were well-defended by their fortress at Red Mountain, but the bravery and cleverness of Nerevar's queen and generals drew most of Dumac's armies out into the field and kept them there, so that Nerevar and Dagoth-Ur could make their way into the Heart Chamber by secret means. There, Nerevar met Dumac and the Dwarf King and they both fell from grievous wounds. Dagoth-Ur slew Kagrenac and took the tools the Dwemer used to tap the power of the Heart. He went to his dying lord Nerevar and asked him what to do with these tools. And Nerevar summoned Azura again, and she showed them how to use the tools to separate the power of the Heart from the Dwemer people.\r\n \r\n\r\nAnd on the fields, the Tribunal and their armies watched as the Dwemer turned into dust all around them as their stolen immortality was taken away.\r\n \r\n\r\nBack in Red Mountain, Nerevar told Dagoth-Ur to protect the tools and the Heart Chamber until he returned. Dagoth-Ur said, \"But shouldn't we destroy these tools at once, so that they might never be used for evil again?\" But Nerevar was confused by his wounds and his sorrow (for he still loved Dumac and the Dwemer people) and so went to the fields outside of Red Mountain to confer with his queen and his generals, who had foreseen that this war would come and whose counsel he would not ignore again. \"I will ask the Tribunal what we shall do with them, for they have had wisdom in the past that I had not. Stay here, loyal Dagoth-Ur, until I return.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nThen Nerevar told his queen and generals all that had transpired under Red Mountain and how the Dwemer had used special tools to turn their people into immortals and of the wondrous power of the Heart of Lorkhan. The Tribunal decided that the Chimer should learn how to use this power so that Nerevar might claim Resdayn and the world for their people. Nerevar did not expect or want this, so he asked his queen and generals to help him summon Azura yet again for her guidance. But the Tribunal had become as greedy as Kagrenac upon hearing of the power of the Heart and they coveted it. They made ritual as if to summon Azura as Nerevar wanted but Almalexia used poisoned candles and Sotha Sil used poisoned robes and Vivec used poisoned invocations. Nerevar was murdered.\r\n \r\n\r\nThen Azura came forth anyway and cursed the Tribunal for their foul deeds. She told them that she would use her powers over dusk and dawn to make sure Nerevar would come back and make things right again. But the Tribunal laughed at her and said that soon they would be gods themselves and that the Chimer people would forget their old ways of worship. And Azura knew this would be true and that it would take a long time before her power might bring Nerevar back. \"What you have done here today is foul beyond measure and you will grow to regret it, for the lives of gods are not what mortals think and matters that weigh only years to mortals weigh on gods forever.\" And so that they might know forever their wicked deeds Azura changed the Chimer into Dunmer, and their skin turned ashen and their eyes into fire. \"Let this mark remind you of your true selves who, like ghouls, fed on the nobility, heroism, and trust of their king.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nAnd then the Tribunal went into Red Mountain and met with Dagoth-Ur. Dagoth-Ur saw what had been done, for his skin had changed as well, and he tried to avenge the death of Nerevar but to no avail. He was driven off and thought dead. The Tribunal found the tools he had been guarding and, through study of Kagrenac's methods, turned themselves into gods.\r\n \r\n\r\nThousands of years after their apotheosis, the Tribunal are still the gods of Morrowind and the old ways of worship are remembered only by a few. And the murder of Nerevar is known to fewer. But his queen and generals still fear his return, for the words of Azura linger long and they see the mark of her curse on their people every day.\r\n ","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n尼瑞瓦在紅山\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>以下內容節錄自阿波科法典籍——也就是裁決者神殿的非正式紀錄。這是由學者將灰地之民傳承的傳統用學術性的體裁重新改寫而成的紀錄，記述著紅山之役以及一連串的相關事件。灰地之民將這些故事和尼瑞瓦的戰友阿蘭卓．蘇的事蹟連結在一起——後者在尼瑞瓦死後以及裁決者晉升至權力核心的期間曾和灰燼人民一起生活。這則故事有許多不同的分枝版本，但傳統上而言主要的元素一直都沒有改變：包括尼瑞瓦遭到殺害、達格斯．烏爾的悲劇命運，以及裁決者的力量來源褻瀆了神，故在神殿教義中被視為灰地之民的無知迷信等等。此外，這些故事的共同點就是比較開化的丹莫對它們都不甚熟悉。\r\n\r\n瑞斯登，也就是今天我們所知道的晨風省，過去曾是兩種不同精靈族爭奪的土地：一是崇拜魔族的奇莫，另一種族則是崇拜某種禁忌神秘力量的鍛莫。這兩支精靈族間爭戰不休，直到他們的土地被另一個更年輕有活力，且更加粗暴的外來文化入侵，那支民族就是所謂的諾德人。\r\n\r\n分別來自奇莫和鍛莫族的兩位英雄——因督利爾．尼瑞瓦和杜馬克．矮獸人，他們讓兩個種族言歸於好，並且共同擊敗了外來的入侵者。之後，這兩位英雄攜手合作了很長一段時間，讓和平得以延續。不過，他們的親信認為這樣的情況不會持續太久，或者應該說，他們並不樂見這樣的情況。尼瑞瓦的妃子和他手下的將軍——愛瑪蕾希雅、索薩．席和維瓦克向他提出建言，要他拿下整個瑞斯登。然而，尼瑞瓦對此充耳不聞。和杜馬克之間的友誼深植於他的心中，他認為和平是唯一的選項。\r\n\r\n這樣的情況一直持續到達格斯．烏爾到來為止。達格斯家族發現了鍛莫禁忌力量的來源：傳說中的洛克汗之心，杜馬克和他的人民藉其力量得以永生且不受諸神的控制。事實上，一位名叫卡格納克的高階祭司正在建造一尊新的神祇，讓鍛莫足以靠他征服整個瑞斯登。\r\n\r\n三位裁決者於是敦促尼瑞瓦再次對鍛莫發動戰爭。尼瑞瓦去會見杜馬克，向這位老朋友質問達格斯．烏爾所說的是否屬實。然而，由於卡格納克和鍛莫高階祭司們對國王隱瞞建造新神一事，因此杜馬克表示鍛莫是清白的，絕無任何不軌意圖。尼瑞瓦對此感到困惑，於是前往阿祖拉的聖殿「荷拉瑪雅」參拜。在那裡，阿祖拉告知他達格斯．烏爾所說的一切都是真的，且鍛莫所建造的新神必須被摧毀，以確保瑞斯登和整個世界的安全。尼瑞瓦返回後，把女神所說的話轉告知三位裁決者，令他們確信事實證明他們是對的，並再次敦促尼瑞瓦發動戰爭。鍛莫和奇莫之間，早就存在著不知多少彼此憎恨的理由了。\r\n\r\n好友杜馬克竟對自己撒謊，此舉終於激怒了尼瑞瓦，於是他動身回到瓦登費爾。這一次，這位奇莫的國王全副武裝，並帶上了人馬。 他嚴厲地對紅山之王杜馬克．矮獸人說：「你必須停止崇拜洛克汗之心，否則我將和你絕交，並毀棄一切過往的盟約！」此時杜馬克對於卡格納克的新神仍舊一無所知，並且極欲保護他引以為傲的人民， 於是答道：「我們不應背棄早已行之多年的道統，就像你們奇莫不會拋棄和湮滅中的魔侯們之間的聯繫一樣。如今你全副武裝且帶著人馬來拜訪我，說明你已經忘了你我之間的情誼。退後，我親愛的尼瑞瓦，否則我以十五加一黃金聲調發誓，一定會殺了你和你的人。」 \r\n\r\n於是，奇莫和鍛莫之間開戰了。鍛莫在紅山的要塞固若金湯，但尼瑞瓦英勇機智的妃子和將軍們將杜馬克大部分的軍隊引到戰場上並把他們絆住，好讓尼瑞瓦和達格斯．烏爾能夠抵達洛克汗之心所在的密室。在那裡，尼瑞瓦和杜馬克交戰後雙雙身受重傷而死，而達格斯．烏爾在砍倒了卡格納克之後，奪走了鍛莫用來從洛克汗之心上萃取力量的工具。他來到彌留之際的國王面前，問他該如何處置這些工具。尼瑞瓦再次召喚了阿祖拉，而她則現身告訴他們該如何用那些工具來切斷洛克汗之心和鍛莫人民間的聯繫。\r\n\r\n此時在戰場上，在鍛莫偷來的永生被奪走之後，裁決者和他們的軍隊親眼目睹對手化為塵土。 \r\n\r\n在紅山這一頭，尼瑞瓦要達格斯．烏爾保護好工具和洛克汗之心的密室，直到他回來。達格斯．烏爾說：「難道我們不該直接毀了這些工具，免得他們再次有機會把工具用於錯誤之途嗎？」然而，身上的傷勢和心中的哀痛讓尼瑞瓦無法做出正確的判斷（因為此時他仍舊敬愛著杜馬克和他的鍛莫子民），於是他走出紅山來到戰場上，和他的妃子與將軍們討論。他們早已預期到這場戰爭的來臨，而這次尼瑞瓦不會再忽視他們的意見了。他說：「我會詢問三位裁決者該怎麼處置這些工具，因為他們有足以預見這一切的智慧，而我沒有。待在這裡，忠誠的達格斯．烏爾，直到我回來為止。」\r\n\r\n尼瑞瓦將發生在紅山下的事告訴了他的妃子和將軍們，包括鍛莫是如何使用那些工具讓他們的人民得到永生，以及洛克汗之心中所蘊含的神奇力量。裁決者們認為奇莫應該學習如何運用這股力量，讓尼瑞瓦拿下瑞斯登和整個世界。尼瑞瓦從未想過這件事，而這也不是他所樂見的，所以他要求妃子和將軍們幫助他再次召喚阿祖拉，以尋求指引。然而，在聽說了洛克汗之心的力量之後，裁決者們已變得和卡格納克一樣貪婪，想要將它據為己有。他們佯裝遵照尼瑞瓦的吩咐舉行召喚阿祖拉的儀式，但愛瑪蕾希雅點上了有毒的蠟燭，索薩．席拿出了有毒的長袍，而維瓦克則拿出了有毒的祭品，尼瑞瓦就這樣被謀殺了。 \r\n\r\n後來阿祖拉主動現身，斥責裁決者們和他們的作為。她對他們說會用自己執掌的暮光與黎明之力讓尼瑞瓦能夠再次歸來並且匡正這一切。對此，裁決者們放聲大笑，並告訴阿祖拉他們即將成為神，而奇莫的人民也將忘記他們古老的信仰。阿祖拉知道他們所言不虛，並且體悟到靠自己的力量讓尼瑞瓦重新歸來需要花上一段很長的時間。於是她說：「你們今天在此所做的是無可饒恕的惡事，你們將會為此感到後悔。神的行為和凡人所想的不同。對凡人而言只是一時的事，對神而言卻是永恆。」為了讓他們永遠銘記自己所背負的罪，阿祖拉將奇莫變成了丹莫，使他們的膚色變得有如灰燼，並讓他們的眼睛如著火一般。最後，她說：「讓這項印記永遠伴隨你們，讓你們牢記自己的真實身分有如食屍的惡鬼一般，靠著吞噬高貴、英勇之德，以及君王的信任維生。」\r\n\r\n後來，裁決者們進入紅山和達格斯．烏爾會合。達格斯．烏爾已經明白發生了什麼事，因為他的皮膚也變了。他試圖為尼瑞瓦報仇，卻徒勞無功，並遭到放逐。裁決者們對外宣稱達格斯．烏爾已死，然後找到了他守護著的工具，再藉由研究卡格納克所用的方法，讓他們成為神祉。\r\n\r\n在神格化以後數千年過去，裁決者們仍舊是晨風的神，只有極少數人還記得古老的信仰。至於尼瑞瓦遭到謀害的真相則更加鮮為人知。儘管如此，尼瑞瓦的妃子和將軍們依然畏懼著他的歸來，因為阿祖拉的話猶在耳際，且她在子民身上所施加的詛咒依然近在眼前。\r\n\r\n","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book4RareNerevaratRedMountain","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02017215|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face='$HandwrittenFont'>\r\n<p align='center'>Each sacrifice brings you closer to that which you seek.</p>","string":"<font face='$HandwrittenFont'>\r\n<p align='center'>每一次犧牲都將讓你離目標更近</p>","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2DunDBRiddle01","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201DA14|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Recipe - Jumping Flame Spider 2x","string":"配方 - 烈焰跳蛛 2x","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2ExpSpiderCrftBookFireJumping2x","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02030C9B|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face=\"$HandwrittenFont\">My dearest Selina,\r\n\r\nEuphemius was killed this morning by one of those awful Rieklings.

It would be easy to dismiss the whole matter as nonsense were it not for the Amulet of Kings. Even the Elder Scrolls do not mention it -- let me correct myself, the Elder Scrolls cannot mention it. When the Moth priests attune the Scrolls to the timeless time their glyphs always disappear. The Amulet of Kings, however, with its oversoul of emperors, can speak of it at length. According to Hestra, Cyrodiil became an Empire across the stars. According to Shor-El, Cyrodiil became an egg. Most say something in a language they can only speak sideways. The Council has collected texts and accounts from all of its provinces, and they only offer stories that never coincide, save on one point: all the folk of Tamriel during the Middle Dawn, in whatever 'when' they were caught in, tracked the fall of the eight stars. And that is how they counted their days.\"\r\n \r\nMehra Nabisi, Dunmer, Triune Mistress of the New Temple:\r\n \r\n\"Accounts of the Middle Dawn are the province of the Empire of Men, and proof of the deceit that call themselves the Aedra. Eight stars fell on Tamriel, one for each iniquity that Lorkhan made clear to the world. Veloth read these signs, and he told Boethiah, who confirmed them, and he told Mephala, who made wards against them, and he told Azura, who sent ALMSIVI to steer the True Folk clear of harm. Even the Four Corners of the House of Troubles rose to protect the periphery of your madness. We watched our borders and saw them shift like snakes, and saw you run around in it like the spirits of old, devoid of math, without your if-thens, succumbing to the Ever Now like slaves of the slim folly, stasis.

R'leyt tells you where: recording it. 'One thousand eight years,' you've heard it. You think the Cyro-Nordics came up with that all on their own. You humans are better thieves than even Rajhin! While you were fighting wars with phantoms and giving birth to your own fathers, it was the Mane that watched the ja-Kha'jay, because the moons were the only constant, and you didn't have the sugar to see it. We'll give you credit: you broke Alkosh something fierce, and that's not easy. Just don't think you solved what you accomplished by it, or can ever solve it. You did it again with Big Walker, not once, but twice! Once at Rimmen, which we'll never learn to live with.

They sought to live life as their ancestors had in Skyrim -- free to kill what they wanted when they wanted, free to worship in any manner they chose.\r\n\r\nThe group braved the harsh weather and traveled south toward Lake Fjalding, where they found the perfect location for a new settlement. There they decided to construct a grand mead hall that would serve as their new home and hunting lodge. After several months of building, the companions had completed the task, and named the mead hall Thirsk.\r\n\r\nThe settlers looked upon all they had accomplished, and were truly proud of their accomplishment. But their happiness was short lived, and the settlers soon learned that not everyone celebrated the construction of Thirsk. As the mead hall was being erected, so too was the noise and commotion of construction disturbing an ancient creature that lay dormant under the ice. It was a tragic twist of irony, therefore, that as the last beam of the great hall was nailed in place, the slumbering beast did finally awaken. His ancient name was the Udyrfrykte, though the settlers knew him only as death. The Udyrfrykte came to the newly completed mead hall and wreaked vengeance upon those who had shattered the peace of his long, cold sleep. He killed without warning, without mercy, reducing the Thirsk Nords to half their number. It was the valiant sorcerer Eldrid Ice-Light who finally drove the beast back to his lair beneath the frozen lake, and used his magicka to seal the entrance with a great wall of ice. The horror was over, but the price was great. It took the settlers two months to fix the damage done by the Udyrfrykte, and with so many strong hands now gone, it was slow and tedious work.\r\n\r\nFinally, Thirsk stood tall and proud once more. But even though the settlers had worked together to construct the mead hall and drive away the threat of the Udyrfrykte, tensions quickly grew over who would serve as their leader. Most of the men considered Hrothmund the Red their de facto chieftain, as he was the strongest and most capable of the lot. But one warrior, Drengr Bronze-Helm, disagreed. He thought himself most capable to rule over Thirsk, and loudly voiced his opposition to Hrothmund. Knowing that conflict and discord would only serve to destroy the new life they had worked so hard to create, Hrothmund the Red exercised his only true option - he swung his great axe and beheaded Drengr Bronze-Helm where he stood. The Nords appreciated more than anything a warrior's prowess in battle, and Drengr's slaying proved to them that Hrothmund was indeed most worthy to be Thirsk's chieftain. So that the other Nords would never forget he had proven his right to lead, Hrothmund placed Drengr's head on a pedestal in the center of Thirsk's main hall, for all to see.\r\n\r\nAnd so began Thirsk's most time-honored tradition. Any warrior, regardless of race or sex, could claim leadership of the mead hall by displaying the most impressive battle trophy on the great hall's pedestal. So long as the spirit of Hrothmund the Red consented, that warrior would be named chieftain.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nHrothmund's Bane\r\n\r\nFor twenty-one years Hrothmund the Red ruled over Thirsk and its residents as chieftain. With his soft voice and great axe, Hrothmund brought peace and prosperity to Thirsk. But peace proved to be Hrothmund's undoing, for the mighty Nord grew restless in the warmth and safety of the mead hall. He longed for battle and adventure, to feel the frost in his veins once more, and could ignore the call of valor no longer. When word spread of a giant, bloodthirsty white wolf terrorizing travelers in the Moesring Mountains, Hrothmund took up his great axe and set out to defeat the beast alone. The men of the mountains named him Ondjage, the Fell Wolf. The beast measured as large as an ox, with fur as white as new-fallen snow, and it was said no man or woman alive could bring Ondjage down. The words of the mountain folk proved true, for while Hrothmund did hew one leg from the Fell Wolf, Ondjage devoured the mighty Nord whole, leaving only his great axe as a grim reminder of man's failure against beast. Filled with sorrow and rage, the residents of Thirsk marched to the mountains in search of the wolf, called by them Hrothmund's Bane. Only together did they manage to slay Ondjage, and as family they feasted on his roasted flesh.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nThe following is a list of Thirsk's chieftains, since Hrothmund first ruled:\r\n\r\nHrothmund the Red. Nord male. Slew Drengr Bronze-Helm and presented his head as a battle trophy. Ruled over Thirsk for twenty-one years. Slain and devoured by Ondjage, the Fell Wolf.\r\n\r\nIsgeror White-Wave. Nord female. Slew the necromancer Hildir Worm-Heart and presented his heart as a battle trophy. Ruled over Thirsk for four years.\r\n\r\nEinarr. Nord male. Slew the frost giant Guolog and presented his foot as a battle trophy. Ruled over Thirsk for six years.\r\n\r\nGisl Round-Gut. Nord male. Slew Einarr and presented his sword as a battle trophy. Ruled over Thirsk for two months.\r\n\r\nEinarr the Younger. Nord male. Slew Gisl Round-Gut and presented his stomach as a battle trophy. Ruled over Thirsk for seven years.\r\n\r\nGrjotgaror. Nord male. Slew the white witch Katla and presented her staff as a battle trophy. Ruled over Thirsk for two years.\r\n\r\nAmelie Bontecou. Breton female. Slew Grjotgaror and presented his head as a battle trophy. Ruled over Thirsk for three years.\r\n\r\nThorormr Storm-Killer. Nord male. Slew the brothers Ani and Ali and presented their enchanted hammers as battle trophies. Ruled over Thirsk for sixteen years.\r\n\r\nAegilief. Nord Female. Slew Oddny the Unfaithful and presented her hand as a battle trophy. Ruled over Thirsk for eight years.\r\n\r\nCaccino Aurelia. Imperial male. Slew the Imperial hero Claudius Anzione and presented his sword as a battle trophy. Ruled over Thirsk for three weeks. Fraud.\r\n\r\nEldjar Bear-Skinner. Nord male. Slew the Imperial fraud Caccino Aurelia and presented his tongue as a battle trophy. Ruled over Thirsk for five years.\r\n\r\nFalki the Fat. Nord male. Slew a pack of six rabid wolves and presented their claws as battle trophies. Ruled over Thirsk for three months. Succumbed to madness and death as a result of rabies.\r\n\r\nSvana the Knife. Nord female. Slew Gretta Wolf-Child and presented her sword as a battle trophy. Ruled over Thirsk for four years.\r\n\r\nBeinir White-Beard. Nord male. Slew three Orc raiders and presented their eyes as battle trophies. Ruled over Thirsk for twenty-two years.\r\n\r\nSkjoldr Wolf-Runner. Nord male. Slew the wizard Griss the Yellow and presented his head as a battle trophy. Ruled over Thirsk for three years. Slain in the mead hall.\r\n\r\nThere is, here, a period of unrecorded histories. At some point, the Udyrfrykte was dealt with once and for all, but the leader of Thirsk in this time is unrecorded. There were, apparently, several other chieftains who came and went before the resumption of record. The Thirsk devotion to oral tradition means these names may forever be lost to history. \r\n\r\nGirgun the Colossus. Nord male. Slew Thjold the Ill-Minded and presented his brains as a battle trophy. Ruled over Thirsk for six years. \r\n\r\nVibeke the Stone. Nord female. Slew seven Imperial pirates and presented their helmets as battle trophies. Ruled over Thirsk for three years. \r\n\r\nHjarknir Green-Hand. Nord male. Slew an entire grove of Spriggans and presented their taproot hearts as battle trophies. Ruled Thirsk for twenty-seven years. \r\n\r\nBujold the Intrepid. Nord female. Slew the great beast of Ilfark and presented its stomach as a battle trophy. Rules Thirsk as of this writing. \r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nExpansion:\r\n\r\nThe Thirsk mead hall is nearly the same today as it was at its founding, a testament to the quality of its construction. But while Thirsk itself did not grow, its inhabitants did, and before long the grand mead hall could not house all who wished to dwell within. So, over the years, many Nords have left Thirsk to establish their own private dwellings out in the wilderness of Solstheim, relying on the island's many caves and natural shelters. But those who left are always welcome back at Thirsk, and many return frequently to enjoy the mead hall's hospitalities. It is also important to note that although much time has passed since the group first left the Skaal village, the Skaal and Thirsk Nords have always remained civil to one another, and even trade resources on occasion.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nRelationship with Raven Rock:\r\n\r\nThe Thirsk Nords hold the same relations with Raven Rock that they once held with the Empire when its presence was more known on Solstheim: a deliberate disinterest and lack of complication. Both sides remain happy if they can plausibly believe the other doesn't exist. Which is not to say there is any cause for enmity; rather, there is simply no cause for fellowship among these two very differing cultures. \r\n[pagebreak]\r\nLaw and Order Within Thirsk:\r\n\r\nWithin the Mead Hall, the Chieftain serves as judge, jury and executioner if necessary. The reality is that Thirsk has always been a fairly peaceful place, with camaraderie and goodwill the norm. Solstheim can be a harsh home, and the Nords of Thirsk have long realized that fighting each other isn't nearly as productive as battling the island's bears, wolves, draugr, Rieklings, and whatever other fell creatures may roam the land. Still, there is the occasional disagreement - which more often than naught ends in bloodshed - and every few years someone gets it into his head to challenge the chieftain to a blood duel to try to gain possession of Thirsk. Generally speaking, the Nords of Thirsk are one big, happy barbarian-like family. And, like any family, they have their squabbles.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nThe Ashtimes:\r\n\r\nSince the eruption of the Red Mountain, the southern portion of Solstheim has been lost to waste and Dark Elf occupation.

In old times, the Chimer worshiped the Daedra as gods. But they did not deserve this veneration, for the Daedra harm their worshippers as often as help them.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Advent of the Tribunal (Blessed Be Their Holy Names) changed this unhappy state. By the Apotheosis, the Tribunal (Blessed Be Their Holy Names) became the Protectors and High Ancestor Spirits of the Dunmer, and bade the Daedra to give proper veneration and obedience. The Three Good Daedra, Boethiah, Azura, and Mephala, recognized the Divinity of the Triune Ancestors (Blessed Be Their Holy Names). The Rebel Daedra, Molag Bal, Malacath, Sheogorath, and Mehrunes Dagon, refused to swear fealty to the Tribunal (Blessed Be Their Holy Names), and their worshippers were cast out.\r\n \r\n\r\nThese Rebel Daedra thus became the Four Corners of the House of Troubles, and they continue to plague our tranquility and tempt the unwary into Heresy and Dark Worship. The Priests of the Temple remain ever vigilant for signs of the Adversaries' return, sometimes aided by the loyal Three Good Daedra, who are familiar with the wiles of their rebellious kin.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Good Daedra are known to the Temple as the Anticipations, since they are the early ancestral anticipations of the loving patronage of the Tribunal. The Anticipations are the Daedra Lords Boethiah, Mephala, and Azura.\r\n \r\n\r\nBoethiah is the Anticipation of Almalexia but male to her female. Boethiah was the ancestor who illuminated the elves ages ago before the Mythic Era. He told them the truth of Lorkhan's test, and defeated Auriel's champion, Trinimac. Boethiah ate Trinimac and voided him. The followers of Boethiah and Trinimac rubbed the soil of Trinimac upon themselves and changed their skins.\r\n \r\n\r\nMephala is the Anticipation of Vivec, but manifold and androgynous. Mephala taught the Chimer to evade their enemies or kill them with secret murder. Enemies were numerous in those days since the Chimer were a small with enemies on all sides. Mephala organized the clan systems that eventually became the Great Houses. Later, Mephala created the Morag Tong.\r\n \r\n\r\nAzura is the Anticipation of Sotha Sil, but female to his male. Azura was the ancestor who taught the Chimer how to be different from the Altmer. Her teachings are sometimes attributed to Boethiah. In the stories, Azura is often encountered more as a communal progenitor of the race as a whole rather than as an individual ancestor. She is associated with Dusk and Dawn, and is sometimes called the Mother Soul. Azura's Star, also called the Twilight Star, appears briefly at dawn and dusk low on the horizon below the constellation of the Steed. Azura is associated with mystery and magic, fate and prophecy.\r\n ","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n預知者\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>魔族外來神是強大的先祖魂，外型與本質皆與裁決者相似（稱頌他們的聖名），但是力量較弱，而且對凡人的事務更專斷也更疏離。古時，奇莫人將魔侯當成聖神崇拜，然而他們不配獲此尊崇，因為魔侯經常傷害其崇拜者，比例跟幫助他們不相上下。\r\n\r\n\r\n裁決者（稱頌他們的聖名）的出現改變了這痛苦的情況。經過神格化，裁決者（稱頌他們的聖名）成為丹莫人的保護者和高等祖靈，並命令魔侯展現適度的敬意和服從。三好魔侯波耶西亞、阿祖拉和梅法拉，被認可為先祖三位一體，是為神（稱頌他們的聖名）。至於造反者魔侯莫拉格．巴爾、瑪拉凱斯、謝爾格拉和梅魯涅斯．大袞，則拒絕向裁決者（稱頌他們的聖名）宣示效忠，他們的崇拜者也遭驅逐。\r\n\r\n\r\n這些反叛者魔侯因而成為動亂之屋的四樁腳，不斷打攪我們的安寧並引誘粗心之人墮入異教崇拜。神殿的祭司隨時警惕著魔鬼再現，他們有時仰仗忠誠的三好魔侯，畢竟他們更為熟知自己的造反同胞有哪些花招詭計。\r\n\r\n\r\n神殿稱呼三好魔侯為預知者，因為他們是扶持裁決者的早期祖先。這三位預知者，即是魔侯波耶西亞、梅法拉和阿祖拉。\r\n\r\n\r\n波耶西亞是愛瑪蕾希雅的預知者，不過是男性。早於神話紀元的許久以前，波耶西亞啟蒙了精靈。他告訴他們洛克汗試煉的真相，並打敗了奧瑞-艾爾的勇士崔尼馬克。波耶西亞吃了崔尼馬克，再將他放出來。波耶西亞和崔尼馬克的追隨者將混含崔尼馬克的土壤抹在自己身上，改變了膚色。\r\n\r\n\r\n梅法拉是維瓦克的預知者，雌雄同體且時時變化。梅法拉教導奇莫人如何躲避或暗殺敵人。在那個時代，到處都是敵人，因為奇莫的人數稀少，敵人則四方皆是。梅法拉將氏族組織起來，演變為今日的豪族。之後，梅法拉成立了魔拉格堂。\r\n\r\n\r\n阿祖拉是索薩．席的預知者，不過是女性。阿祖拉教導奇莫人如何有別於先祖精靈。有時候她的教誨被歸於波耶西亞。在故事裡，阿祖拉經常是以全種族的祖先之姿而非個體之祖出現。她與晨昏密切相連，有時候被稱作神母之靈。阿祖拉之星也叫微明之星，在黃昏和黎明時會短暫低掛在地平線上，位於駿馬星座下方。阿祖拉涉及神秘與魔法、命運和預言。\r\n","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book3ValuableTheAnticipations","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02028269|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Lives of the Saints","string":"聖人之道","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book2ReligiousLivesoftheSaints","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201AABA|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face'$HandwrittenFont'><font size='40'><p align='center'>\r\nConjure Ash Guardian","string":"<font face'$HandwrittenFont'><font size='40'><p align='center'>\r\n召喚灰燼守護者","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2SpellTomeConjureAshGuardian","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02026D56|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<p align='center'><font face='$HandwrittenFont'><font size='25'>\r\n\r\n\r\nFlawless Amethyst Gem\r\n\r\nDamaged Albino Spider Pod\r\n\r\n</font></p>\r\n","string":"<p align='center'><font face='$HandwrittenFont'><font size='25'>\r\n\r\n\r\n無瑕紫水晶\r\n\r\n受損的白化蜘蛛卵囊\r\n\r\n</font></p>\r\n","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2ExpSpiderCrftBookShockBomb2x","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02029102|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Trap","string":"圈套","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book3ValuableTrap","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02028274|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"The Poison Song, Book VII","string":"毒藥之頌，第七冊","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book1CheapPoisonSong7","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02026D55|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK CNAM","original":"Amethyst + Damaged Albino Spider Pod","string":"紫水晶 + 受損白化蜘蛛卵囊","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2ExpSpiderCrftBookShockBomb","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201FF2A|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face=\"$HandwrittenFont\" size=\"18\">\r\nFind that fool who helped Drovas.

They welcomed me into their homes, one and all, without the slightest hint of suspicion or uncertainty. Trust, it seems, comes readily to the Skaal.\r\n\r\nIn appearance, the Skaal are clearly of Nord ancestry. However, they are culturally distinct in several significant ways, the most notable of which is their faith. Having never adopted the pantheon of the Empire, the Skaal recognize only a single deity whom they call the All-Maker.\r\n\r\nFor the Skaal, the All-Maker is the source of all life and creation. When a creature dies, its spirit returns to the All-Maker, who shapes it into something new and returns it to Mundus. The concept of death as an ending to life is unknown to the Skaal. Rather, death is seen as simply the beginning of the next stage of an endless journey.\r\n\r\nThis great respect for life is evident in one of the most important Skaal beliefs, a concept the villagers call \"one-ness with the land\". The Skaal try to live in harmony with their surroundings, making as small an impact on their environment as possible. When a Skaal villager sets out to collect firewood, for example, he or she takes it from fallen, dead trees. When the Skaal hunt, it is only out of necessity, and not for sport. Because they hold all life in great reverence, the Skaal people will resort to violence only as a last resort.\r\n\r\nThis has understandably led to a rather austere lifestyle for these simple, good-natured folk. For the Skaal, the word \"luxury\" is nearly an alien concept, though I was intrigued to note that one villager, Edla, has taken to trading basic goods with travelers who pass through the village in exchange for small luxury items. Such an enterprising outlook is something of a novelty for the Skaal.\r\n\r\nThough it saddens me to conclude this account on such a somber note, it is impossible to deny the hard truth that the Skaal people are dwindling. In a century or two, it is possible that their unique way of life will be lost to the world forever, reduced to little more than a footnote in the great epoch of history. \r\n\r\nThis comes as little surprise, given the immense hardships of a life lived in such an extreme environment. For the Skaal, it is a daily struggle to survive the perpetual wintry climate of northern Solstheim, but other challenges have recently appeared. \r\n\r\nThe ashfall from Vvardenfell has taken its toll on the plants and animals upon which the Skaal depend for their survival, and life is now a struggle for all who call Solstheim home.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I humbly beseech any students of history who might encounter this modest text to travel to Solstheim and learn all that can be learned of this noble people and their ancient customs. The Skaal people might not be long for this world, but let us assure that their proud and noble legacy lasts well into the future.\r\n\r\n","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n萬物之始的孩子\r\n\r\n獨孤城的沙爾斯坦 \r\n著\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/I_letter.png'>如果這標題在你看來很熟稔，那麼也許你跟我一樣，相當樂於認識這些最出色非凡的人——索瑟海姆的斯卡爾。\r\n\r\n跟這些和善的荒野之人初次會面，我就立刻對他們的熱情好客留下深刻印象。他們邀我進屋，每個人都一樣，毫無任何猜忌或遲疑。信任感，似乎輕而易舉就在斯卡爾人心中深植發芽。\r\n\r\n由外表看來，斯卡爾人與諾德祖先相差無幾，可是在文化上卻有許多相異之處，最明顯的差異就是他們的信仰。斯卡爾人從未吸納帝國的眾神，他們只信奉一位他們稱為「萬物之始」的神祇。\r\n\r\n對斯卡爾人而言，萬物之始是所有生命和萬物的起源。當一條生命逝去，靈魂就會回歸萬物之始，經他重塑成新型體後再遣回夢達思。死亡等同生命的終結，這樣的概念在斯卡爾人是天方夜譚。他們視死亡為踏上無盡旅程下一個階段的開始，就這麼簡單。\r\n\r\n對生命的無比敬重，在斯卡爾人最重要的觀念之一就可以清楚看到，村民稱此概念為「與大地合一」。斯卡爾人試著和環境和諧相處，盡可能減少對環境的衝擊。舉例來說，當一個斯卡爾村民外出收集木柴，他或她只會從倒下或死亡的樹木下手；而打獵則是出於必要，並非運動娛樂。因為對天下萬物無比敬畏，非到萬不得已，斯卡爾人不會訴諸暴力。\r\n\r\n這樣的信仰讓這些單純善良的人維持著相當儉樸的生活。對斯卡爾人來說，「奢侈」這個詞相當奇怪，儘管我曾注意到有個叫艾蒂拉的村民開始用必需品跟行經村莊的旅人交換漂亮的小東西。如此大膽的行徑在斯卡爾人之間實屬新奇。\r\n\r\n雖然以如此陰鬱的口氣為這篇記述作結實在令我難過，但斯卡爾人正在凋零，這是無可否認的嚴峻事實。在一兩百年內，他們獨特的生活方式很可能永遠從世上消失，僅僅成為歷史上一個大時代的註腳。\r\n\r\n考量他們在這種極端環境下過著無比艱困的生活，這結果並不令人意外。對斯卡爾人來說，要在北索瑟海姆無休止的寒冷氣候求溫飽已不容易，可是其他挑戰近來陸續出現。\r\n\r\n來自瓦登費爾的飛灰佔據了斯卡爾人賴以維生的動植物，如今對所有以索瑟海姆為家的生命而言，生活盡是掙扎與奮鬥。\r\n\r\n因此，我謙卑地懇求任何學習歷史的人，如果你們恰巧涉獵了這篇審慎的文章，請你們前往索瑟海姆，竭盡所能地學習這群高尚的人民和他們古老的習俗。斯卡爾人或許終將從這個世界消失，但我們卻可以盡力確保將他們值得驕傲且崇高的生活智慧傳承下去。","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book3ValuableChildrenOfTheAllMaker","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02017276|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face='$HandwrittenFont'>\r\n\r\n<p align='center'>Stay your course.</p>\r\n<p align='center'>To idle is to die.</p>","string":"<font face='$HandwrittenFont'>\r\n\r\n<p align='center'>勇往直前，</p>\r\n<p align='center'>發呆者死。</p>","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2DunDBRiddle02","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0202826A|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\nNchunak's Fire and Faith \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>his book is a translated account of Nchunak's travels among the various colonies of the Dwemer explaining the theories of Kagrenac.\r\n \r\nI made inquiry as to the state of enlightenment among the people he spoke for.

Even though everything seemed serene (the last embers crackling in the hearth; young servant girl and her child slumbering in a chair by the door; a tapestry half-finished against the wall, waiting to be completed tomorrow; one of the moons visible through a milky cloud outside the window; a lone bird, out of sight in the rafters, cooing placidly), Tay heard the first chords of the Song strike dissonantly somewhere far away.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe bird in the rafters croaked and took flight through the window. The baby in the girl's arms woke and began to scream. The Song swelled in intensity, yet still remained subtle and stately in tempo. The movement of everything seemed to take on the rhythm of the music as if strange choreography had been staged: the girl rising to the window, the clouds reflecting back red from the inferno below, her scream, all muted, consumed by the Song. Everything that came thereafter Tay had seen so many times, it had almost ceased to be a nightmare.\r\n \r\n\r\nHe did not remember anything of his life before coming to the island of Gorne, but he understood that there was something different in his past that set him apart from his cousins. It wasn't simply that his parents were dead. His cousin Baynarah's parents had also died in the War. Nor were the other Housemen on Gorne or nearby Mournhold unusually cruel to him. They treated him with the same polite indifference that any Indoril has for every other eight-year-old boy that got underfoot.\r\n \r\n\r\nBut somehow, with absolutely certainty, Tay knew he was alone. Different. Because of a Song he always heard, and his nightmares.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"You're certainly imaginative,\" his aunt Ulliah would smile patiently, before waving him away so she could return to her scriptures and chores.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Different? Everyone in the world thinks they're 'different,' that's what makes it such a common sentiment,\" said his older cousin Kalkorith who was studying to be Temple priest and had a firm grasp on paradoxes.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"If you tell anyone else that you keep hearing music where there's no music to be heard, they'll call you mad and bury you in the Shrine of Sheogorath,\" his uncle Triffith would snarl, before striding away to attend his business.\r\n \r\n\r\nOnly his nursemaid Edebah would listen to him seriously, and just nod with a faint look of pride. But she would never say another word.\r\n \r\n\r\nHis cousin and chief playmate Baynarah was by far the least interested in the stories of his Song and his dreams.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"How tiresome you are with all this, Tay,\" said Baynarah, after luncheon the summer of his eighth year. He, she, and a younger cousin Vaster walked into a clearing in the midst of flowering trees. The grass was very low, barely up to their ankles, and there were big black piles of leaves from the previous autumn. \"Now, shall we get back to it? What shall we play?\"\r\n \r\n\r\nTay thought for a moment. \"We could play the Siege of Orsinium.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Vaster, their constant companion, three years their junior.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Orsinium was the home of the orcs, off in the Wrothgarian Mountains. For hundreds of years, it kept growing bigger and bigger and bigger. The orcs would come down out of the mountains and rape and pillage all over High Rock. And then, King Joile of Daggerfall and Gaiden Shinji of the Order of Diagna and someone else, I forget, from Sentinel all joined together against Orsinium. For thirty years they fought and fought. Orsinium had walls made out of iron and, try as they might, they couldn't break through.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"So what happened?\" asked Baynarah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"You're so good at making up things that never happened, why don't you make it up?\"\r\n \r\n\r\nSo they did. Tay was the King of the Orcs, perched up in a tree they called Orsinium. Baynarah and Vaster played King Joile and Gaiden Shinji and they threw pebbles and sticks up at Tay while he taunted them in his most guttural voice. The three decided that the Goddess Kynareth (played by Baynarah in dual role) answered the prayers of Gaiden Shinji and drenched Orsinium in a torrent of rain. The walls rusted and dissolved. On cue, Tay obligingly fell from the tree and let King Joile and Gaiden Shinji mangle him with their enchanted blades.\r\n \r\n\r\nFor the most of that summer, the year 675 of the First Era, Tay was nearly insensible by the power of the sun. There were no clouds, but it rained most every night, so the vegetation on the island of Gorne was bewildering lush. The stones themselves seemed to glow with sunlight, and the ditches burned with white meadowsweet and parsleydown; all around him were soft smells of flower and tree untroubled by wind; the foliage was purple green, blue green, ash green, white green. The wide cupolas, twisting cobbled streets, and thatched roofs of the little village of Gorne, and massive bleached rock of Sandil House all were magical to him.\r\n \r\n\r\nYet the dreams haunted his nights and the Song continued whether he was awake or not.\r\n \r\n\r\nAgainst Aunt Ulliah's admonishments, Tay, Baynarah, and Vaster had breakfast outdoors every morning with the servants. Ulliah would hold an interior breakfast for herself and any visiting dignitaries: guests were rare, so she often ate alone. At first the servants would dine in silence, attempting gentility, but they broke down and would regale the children with gossip, reports, stories, and rumors.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Poor Arnyle is laid up with a fever again.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm telling you, they're cursed. The whole lot of 'em. Piss on the faerie and they piss right back on you.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Doesn't Little Miss Starsia look, oh, just a wee bit tight around the belly region late-ly?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"She's not!\" \r\n\r\n\r\nThe only servant who didn't speak at all was Tay's nursemaid Edebah. She wasn't pretty like the other maids, but the scars on her face did not deform her. Her poorly set broken nose and her short hair gave her a certain alien mystique. She would merely quietly smile at the gossip, and look at Tay with almost frightening love and devotion.\r\n \r\n\r\nOne day, after breakfast, Baynarah whispered to Tay and Vaster, \"We have to go to the hills on the other side of the island.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nShe had used such imperatives before and always had something wonderful to show: a waterfall, tucked away behind ferns and tall rocks; a sunny grove of figs; a discreet still some peasants had set up; a sickly oak, twisted into a kneeling human figure; a collapsed stone wall that they imagined was thousands of years old, the last refuge of a doomed princess they named Merella.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe three walked across through the forest until they came to a clearing. A few hundred feet beyond, the meadow sank to a dry creek bed, filled with small, smooth stones. They followed that into the dark woods where trees canopied high over their heads. Sporadic red and yellow blossoms burst along the moist underbrush, but they became rarer and rarer as the children marched on under the umbrageous oaks and elms. The air crackled with birds ticking a staccato choral piece, a minor chord of the Song.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Where are we going?\" asked Tay. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"It's not where we're going, it's what we're going to see,\" replied Baynarah. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe forest surrounded the three children completely, bathed them in its tenebrous hues, and breathed on them with wet chirrups and sighs. It was easy for them to imagine that they were within a monster, walking along its twisted spine of stones.\r\n \r\n\r\nBaynarah scrambled up the steep hill and peered through the thick mass of shrub and tree. Tay lifted Vaster out of the creek bed and climbed out, gripping soft grass for support. There was no path through the forest here. Brambles and low hanging branches struck at them like the claws of chained beasts. The cries of the birds became ever more stentorious, as if angered at the invasion. One limb drew blood on Vaster's cheek, but he didn't cry out. Even Baynarah, who could pass like an ethereal creature through impenetrable forests, had a braid catch on a bramble, ruining the intricate pattern a servant had woven hours before. She paused to pull out the other braid, so her bright unruly tresses fell freely behind her. Now she was something wild, a nymph guiding the other two through her woodland domain. The Song began to beat like a wild pulse.\r\n \r\n\r\nThey were on a shelf of stone below a cliff overlooking a tremendous gorge, staring over an expanse of cinder. It looked like the scene of a tremendous battle, a holocaust of fire. Charred boxes, weaponry, animal bones, and detritus too annihilated to be identifiable littered the ground. Speechless, Tay and Vaster stepped into the black field. Baynarah smiled, proud that she had finally found something of true wonder and mystery.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"What is this place?\" asked Vaster at last. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" Baynarah shrugged. \"I thought at first that it was some kind of ruin, but now I think it's a junk pile, just not like any junk pile I've ever seen. Just look at this stuff.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nThe three began an unorganized survey of the dusty mounds of refuse. Baynarah found a twisted sword only lightly blackened by flame and began polishing it to read the inscriptions on the blade. Vaster amused himself by breaking brittle boxes with his hands and feet, imagining himself a giant of unbelievable strength. A battered shield attracted Tay: there was something about it that reverberated with the sound of the Song. He pulled it out, and wiped its surface clean.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I've never seen that crest before,\" said Baynarah, looking over Tay's shoulder.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I think I have, but I don't remember,\" Tay whispered, trying to conjure the memory from his dreams. He was sure he had seen it there.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Look at this!\" Vaster cried, interrupting Tay's thoughts. The boy was holding up a crystal orb. As his hand moved over the surface, brushing away grit and dust, a key in the Song rose which sent a shiver through Tay's entire body. Baynarah ran over to look at Vaster's treasure, but Tay felt paralyzed.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Where did you find that?\" she gasped, gazing into the swirl beneath the crystal surface.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Over in that wagon,\" Vaster gestured toward a heap of blackened wood, barely discernible from the other piles but for its cart spokes. Baynarah began digging into the half-collapsed structure, so only her feet could be seen. The Song built in potency, sweeping over Tay. He began walking toward Vaster slowly.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Give me that,\" he whispered in a voice he could barely recognize as his own. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Vaster whispered back, his eyes locked on the colors reflected in the heart of the globe. \"It's mine.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nBaynarah dug through the remains of the wagon for several more minutes, but she could find no treasures like Vaster's. Most everything within was destroyed, and what remained was common-place by any standards: broken arrows, armor shards, guar bones. Frustrated, she pulled herself out into the sunlight.\r\n \r\n\r\nTay was alone, at the edge of the great gorge. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Where's Vaster?\" \r\n\r\n\r\nTay blinked and then turned back to his cousin with a shrug and a grin: \"He went back to show everyone his new plunder. Did you find anything interesting?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Not really,\" said Baynarah. \"We probably ought to get back home before Vaster tells them anything that'll get us in trouble.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nTay and Baynarah started the walk back at a quick pace. Tay knew that Vaster would not be there when they got back. He would never be returning home again. The crystal globe rested snugly in Tay's satchel, hidden under a pile of junk he had picked up. With all his heart, he prayed for the Song to return and drown out the memory of the gorge and the long, silent fall down. The boy had been so surprised, he hadn't even time to scream.\r\n \r\n","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n毒藥之頌 \r\n第一冊 \r\n\r\n畢斯汀．謝爾 \r\n著\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p

\r\n\r\n\r\n「你只是想像力過剩，」他的姑姑烏黎雅會先耐心笑笑，然後擺擺手要他離開，以便重拾她的經文和雜事。 \r\n\r\n\r\n「不一樣？世界上每個人都覺得自己『與眾不同』，於是大家都一樣變得多愁善感，」泰伊的堂哥凱寇里斯如是說，他正努力學習，準備成為神殿祭司，對似是而非的悖論非常有一套。\r\n\r\n\r\n「如果你跟其他人說你老是在沒音樂的地方聽到音樂，他們會說你瘋了，然後把你埋在席歐鉤拉思祭壇，」他的叔叔崔斐斯會先這樣大吼，然後大步走開做自己的事。\r\n\r\n\r\n只有他的保母艾蒂芭會認真聽他說話，不怎麼自豪地點頭，但她從不曾多言。\r\n\r\n\r\n堂姐蓓娜拉是泰伊主要的玩伴，也是目前為止對他的歌和惡夢最不感興趣的人。\r\n\r\n\r\n「整天說這個你不煩嗎，泰伊，」在他八歲時的夏天，蓓娜拉說道。泰伊、蓓娜拉和他們的堂弟瓦士特走進繁花盛開的林中空地。這裡的草非常短，幾乎不到他們的腳踝，還有之前秋天餘下的成堆發黑樹葉。「我們說點別的吧，玩什麼好呢？」\r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊想了一會兒。「我們可以玩奧辛紐姆圍城。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「那是什麼？」他們的好同伴、小三歲的瓦士特問道。\r\n\r\n\r\n「奧辛紐姆是獸人的家，深隱沃斯格理安山脈之中，幾百年下來，這個城市越來越大越來越大。時不時，獸人會下山，來到高岩劫財劫色。後來，匕首雨的爵勒王和狄亞格納騎士團的蓋登．辛吉還有來自看守者之城的某個人，我忘了名字，他們聯手對付奧辛紐姆，奮力不懈地打了三十年。奧辛紐姆有鐵牆守護，無論他們如何嘗試，就是無法攻破入城。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「後來呢？」蓓娜拉發問。\r\n\r\n\r\n「你很會憑空捏造故事，乾脆就編一下嘛！」 \r\n\r\n\r\n於是他們開始天馬行空。泰伊是獸人國王，高高鎮守在一棵他們稱作奧辛紐姆的樹上。蓓娜拉和瓦士特則扮演爵勒王和蓋登．辛吉，在泰伊壓低了嗓音奚落他們時，朝泰伊丟擲小石頭和小樹枝。他們三人決定讓女神凱娜瑞絲（由蓓娜拉分飾兩角）回應蓋登．辛吉的祈禱，用滂沱大雨淹沒奧辛紐姆，鐵牆終於腐朽崩潰。就在此時，泰伊樂地從樹上落地，讓爵勒王和蓋登．辛吉用他們的附魔刀劍將他大卸八塊。\r\n\r\n\r\n第一紀元675年夏天的大多數時間，泰伊幾乎感受不到太陽的威力。儘管萬里無雲，但卻幾乎每晚下雨，葛尼島上的植被因此無比繁茂。石頭彷彿會隨陽光發亮，溝渠則長滿繡線菊和荷蘭芹；圍繞泰伊四周是花朵的輕柔香氣和不受風兒打擾的青翠樹木——純綠、藍綠、灰綠、白綠。寬大的穹頂、彎曲的卵石街道、葛尼島上小村莊的茅草屋頂，以及杉笛爾之屋那白色巨石，在泰伊眼中好像全撒上了魔法。\r\n\r\n\r\n可是無論是否清醒，盤據他夜晚的夢境還有那首歌依然持續。 \r\n\r\n\r\n每天早上，泰伊、蓓娜拉和瓦士特都不顧烏黎雅姑姑的訓誡，和僕人在戶外享用早餐。烏黎雅只可能在室內吃早餐，她的顯要訪客也沒有其他選擇，不過客人來訪並不頻繁，因此她通常都獨自一人。傭人們起初都靜靜用餐，維持應有的禮節，不過後來他們打破了規則，開始用閒聊、傳聞、故事和謠言娛樂孩子們。\r\n\r\n\r\n「可憐的雅尼利又發燒了。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「我說啊，他們被詛咒了，每個人都是。對著仙女小便，她們也會照樣回敬你。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「絲達西雅小小姐的肚子附近看起來，呃，是不是有一點點緊呀？」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「才沒呢！」\r\n\r\n唯一不發一語的僕人，便是泰伊的保母艾蒂芭。雖然她不像其他女僕那樣漂亮，但她臉上的疤也沒有讓她變醜。她斷過的鼻子和一頭短髮，讓她有種異於他人的神秘。她只會在大家閒談時靜靜微笑，然後以近乎嚇人的愛意和忠誠看著泰伊。\r\n\r\n\r\n有一天吃完早餐後，蓓娜拉小聲對泰伊和瓦士特說：「我們得去島嶼另一邊的小山丘。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n以前她也用過這種命令口吻，而且總是讓他們大開眼界：一座藏在蕨類和高聳岩石間的瀑布；一棵酷似蹲下人形的生病橡樹；一面在他們想像中有千年歷史的坍塌石牆，那兒是落難公主麥蕊拉（名字是他們取的）最後的避難所。\r\n\r\n\r\n他們三個人穿過森林，來到一片空地。前方幾百碼，草地陷落乾涸的河床，河道上布滿光滑的小石子。他們沿著河道走進黑暗的樹林，每棵樹都高聳入天。潮濕的灌木叢點綴著紅與黃的花朵，可是隨著孩子們在連綿成蔭的橡樹和榆樹一路前進，灌木叢變得越來越少。氣氛因鳥兒而活絡，牠們斷續的合唱，唱出那首歌的小和弦。\r\n \r\n\r\n「我們要去哪裡？」泰伊問道。\r\n\r\n\r\n「重點不是我們要去哪裡，而是我們會看到什麼，」蓓娜拉回答。\r\n\r\n\r\n濃密的森林團團圍住三個孩子，在他們身上灑下陰暗的色調，輕送出蟲鳴鳥叫和幽幽嘆息。他們輕易就能想像自己其實身在怪獸體內，正沿著牠彎彎曲曲的石頭脊椎往前走。\r\n\r\n\r\n蓓娜拉爬上陡峭的山丘，從濃密的大樹和灌木之間窺看。泰伊把瓦士特抬出河道，然後自己抓著柔軟的草當支撐爬出來。這裡沒有穿過森林的路徑。刺藤和低矮的樹枝打在他們身上，彷彿被鍊住的野獸伸出利爪。鳥鳴似乎益發響亮，好像在對有人入侵表達不滿。有根樹枝在瓦士特的臉頰畫出一道血痕，但他沒有痛喊。就連可以靈活穿梭茂密林間的蓓娜拉，也被刺藤鉤住一條辮子，扯壞了之前僕人花費數小時編綁的繁複花樣。她停下腳步，鬆開另一條辮子，讓一頭自有生命力的秀髮隨意披散身後。現在的她充滿野性，像個小仙女帶領另外兩人穿越她的森林屬地。那首歌開始擊出節奏，有如失控的脈搏。\r\n\r\n\r\n他們在一塊峭壁下方的突出岩石之上，俯瞰一座極深的峽谷，凝望一大片灰燼。那看來像大型戰役的場景，烈火肆虐：燒黑了的箱子、武器軍備、動物骸骨，和毀損嚴重到無法辨認為何的碎屑散落在地。泰伊和瓦士特啞口無言地踏上黑色的土地。蓓娜拉面露微笑，對自己終於找到神秘非凡的奇景，感到無比驕傲。\r\n\r\n\r\n「這是什麼地方？」瓦士特好不容易才能開口。\r\n\r\n\r\n「我不知道，」蓓娜拉聳聳肩。「我本來以為是某種廢墟，但是現在我覺得是垃圾堆，只不過跟以前見過的不一樣。看看這些東西。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n他們三個人開始隨意在灰塵滿布的土石堆中翻找。蓓娜拉發現一把只有一點點燻黑的怪劍，便開始擦拭好看清楚刀刃上的刻印。瓦士特手腳並用地破壞脆弱的盒子自娛，想像自己是有超大力氣的巨人。而泰伊則被一個壓扁了的盾牌吸引：它跟那首歌有某種關聯。他把盾牌拉出來，將表面擦乾淨。\r\n\r\n\r\n「我沒看過這個徽飾，」蓓娜拉從泰伊的肩上探過頭。\r\n\r\n\r\n「我覺得我有，只是不記得了，」泰伊悄聲說，試圖從夢中喚回記憶。他很確定他曾在夢中看過這個。 \r\n\r\n\r\n「你們看！」瓦士特大喊，打斷了泰伊的思緒。男孩高舉著一顆水晶球。當他的手滑過球體表面，抹去砂礫和塵土，那首歌的一個音階突然出現，一陣顫慄竄過泰伊全身。蓓娜拉跑去看瓦士特的寶貝，但泰伊卻動彈不得。 \r\n\r\n\r\n「你在哪裡找到的？」她上氣不接下氣，專注凝視著水晶表層下的漩渦。 \r\n\r\n\r\n「在那邊那輛馬車上，」瓦士特指著一堆變黑了的木頭，乍看之下跟其他廢物堆沒什麼不同，唯有車身道出它原本的身分。蓓娜拉開始往下挖掘半塌的結構體，因此從外只能看到她的腳。那首歌的力量逐漸增強，席捲而過泰伊。他開始慢慢朝瓦士特走去。\r\n\r\n\r\n「把那個給我，」他幾乎認不出那低語的嗓音是自己的。\r\n\r\n\r\n「不要，」瓦士特小聲回道，眼睛緊盯著球體中心反射而出的色彩。「這是我的。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n蓓娜拉又繼續在馬車的殘骸堆挖了幾分鐘，不過卻沒有瓦士特的好運。大部分的東西都已毀壞，剩下的都是普通的玩意兒：斷掉的箭、盔甲殘片、軋獸的骨頭。她相當失望地回到陽光之下。\r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊一個人站在大峽谷邊。\r\n\r\n\r\n「瓦士特呢？」\r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊眨眨眼，然後轉身聳個肩，咧嘴一笑。「他回去跟大家炫耀他的新發現了。妳有找到什麼有趣的東西嗎？」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「沒有，」蓓娜拉說。「我們差不多該回去了，免得瓦士特說溜嘴，害我們倒楣。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊和蓓娜拉快步往回走。泰伊知道他們回去時，不會看到瓦士特。他永遠不會回家了。那顆水晶球被好好地收在泰伊的背包裡，藏在一堆他撿來的舊東西下面。他全心全意祈禱那首歌再度響起，驅走峽谷的回憶和那漫長卻沉默的墜落。男孩實在太過驚訝，連大叫的時間都沒有。","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book1CheapPoisonSong1","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201DA0F|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK

So much has happened to this tiny town in such a short amount of time, and so many lives have been affected by it, I felt it necessary to describe its rich history within these volumes. During my research, I lived in Raven Rock for almost three years, and I got to know many of my fellow Dunmer who call Raven Rock their home. I hope that my readers will appreciate the amount of fortitude and perseverance that it must take to endure life in such an inhospitable and untamed land.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/R_letter.png'>aven Rock was founded in 3E 427 by the East Empire Company in response to the discovery of a rich ebony mine on the southern edge of the island of Solstheim. The construction of the town took several months, and the mine immediately started yielding ebony ore that the miner's shipped to Windhelm in Skyrim. By 3E 432, the town was home to over thirty people, all of whom depended on the mine for their livelihood. At this time, Raven Rock was almost exclusively inhabited by Imperials and a few Nords who were drawn to the mine's wealth.\r\n\r\nWhen the Oblivion Crisis arose in 3E 433, Raven Rock remained largely untouched by Mehrunes Dagon's forces and work continued as usual. The bulk of the Imperial Guard that was stationed in Raven Rock was recalled to Cyrodiil to fight the invading forces, but a few soldiers remained behind in order to protect the ebony mine from bandits. It's uncertain whether any Oblivion Gates ever opened on Solstheim, as there appears to be no record of such an event ever occurring there.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of the Fourth Era, after the destruction of Ald'ruhn, many of the Dunmer Great Houses sent out small groups of their own to seek places to reestablish themselves. House Redoran's group was led by Brara Morvayn who immediately struck out for Solstheim. After some quick negotiations with the East Empire Company (and some speculate quite a bit of coin changing hands), Brara's group was allowed to settle in Raven Rock where they quickly became a part of the mining colony's way of life. The Dunmer proved to be both hard-working and reliable when it came to working in the mines, impressing the East Empire Company and solidifying their relationship.\r\n\r\nAll was going quite well until that fateful day in 4E 5 when the Red Mountain suddenly erupted, sending a massive blast across the Sea of Ghosts that struck Solstheim with its full fury. Raven Rock was heavily damaged by this wave of force, which toppled several of its stone structures and obliterated many of the wooden ones. Ironically, the mine once again proved to be the town's saving grace, as most of the population of Raven Rock was working underground at the time, and was completely shielded from the blast. This event wasn't without cost, however. Raven Rock was heavily dependent on nearby Fort Frostmoth for its defense, but the eruption had almost completely wiped it from the face of Solstheim. The few soldiers that survived took residence in Raven Rock itself and attempted to set up a makeshift garrison there, but these scant few were hardly a match for potential threats to their town. With the East Empire Company's permission, Brara brought in some of House Redoran's elite \"Redoran Guard\" to fill the void. The guard proved to be an ideal replacement for the fallen Imperial soldiers and have been guarding the town ever since.\r\n</p>","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n鴉石鎮簡史\r\n第一卷\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n萊林．特列羅\r\n著\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n前言\r\n\r\n鴉石鎮是過去兩百年間晨風省最有趣的殖民地之一。這座小鎮在短時間內實在發生了太多事情，受影響的居民不計其數，使我覺得有必要用這些篇幅來記下它豐富的歷史。研究期間，我在鴉石鎮住了將近三年，因此也認識了不少以鴉石鎮為家的丹莫。希望讀者們體察，在這樣一個未開化且不宜人居的土地上生活，究竟需要多少的堅忍與毅力。\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/R_letter.png'>鴉石鎮成立於第三紀元427年，當時東帝國貿易公司在索瑟海姆島的南端發現了一處蘊藏量豐富的黑檀岩礦脈。花了幾個月完成本鎮的建設工程後，礦坑便立刻開始出產黑檀岩礦石，並運往天際省的風舵城。到了第三紀元432年，有超過三十名以上的人口住在此地，全都仰賴礦業維生。此時鴉石鎮的居民幾乎全為帝國人，僅有少數幾名諾德人，而他們全都是被礦坑所帶來的財富吸引而來。\r\n\r\n當第三紀元433年湮滅危機爆發時，鴉石鎮幾乎未受到梅魯涅斯．大袞的勢力影響，一切照常運作。當時駐守在鴉石鎮的帝國守衛被召回賽瑞迪爾以對抗入侵，不過卻也有少數幾名士兵留下防守黑檀岩礦坑免受強盜侵害。雖然湮滅之門究竟有無在索瑟海姆開啟不得而知，但至少在正式紀錄上從未發生過這樣的事情。.\r\n\r\n到了第四紀元的元年，在奧德魯恩毀滅後，許多丹莫豪族紛紛派出族人尋找重建家園之所。 其中瑞多然家族所派出的團隊由布萊拉．莫爾凡領導，他們直接往索瑟海姆出發。在快速地與東帝國貿易公司協商（據說有筆不算小的金錢往來）之後， 布萊拉的團隊獲准在鴉石鎮落腳，而他們也迅速成為這座礦業殖民地的一份子。丹莫證明了他們是刻苦耐勞且可靠的礦工， 這不僅讓東帝國貿易公司留下深刻印象，也加深了兩者間的關係。\r\n\r\n原本一切都相當順利，直到命運的那一天來臨。第四紀元5年，紅山突然爆發， 大量的烈焰甚至越過鬼魂之海直接衝擊索瑟海姆。鴉石鎮因此受到重創，不僅有幾座石造建築倒塌，還有許多木造建築全毀。諷刺的是，礦坑在這起事件中再次被證明了是鴉石鎮的救星，大多數人於事發當時正在地底工作，因此完全未受到火山爆發影響。然而，這起事件還是令居民付出了代價。鴉石鎮在防衛上極度仰賴附近的霜蛾堡壘，但紅山這次爆發幾乎將堡壘自索瑟海姆島完全抹去。少數生存下來的士兵進入鴉石鎮，並試圖建立一個臨時駐紮地，然而他們的人數實在太少，不足以應付鴉石鎮所面對的潛在威脅。於是，在東帝國貿易公司批准下，布萊拉引進了一些瑞多然家族的精英部隊「瑞多然禁衛隊」來填補空缺。這群守衛完美地取代了帝國士兵遺留的空缺，自那時起便一直守護鴉石鎮至今。\r\n</p>\r\n","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book2CommonRavenRock01","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0202AD41|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face='$HandwrittenFont'>\r\nMy dearest daughter Sapphire,\r\n\r\nIt's with a heavy heart that I write this letter.

I awoke the next morning when the most beautiful woman I'd ever laid eyes upon walked in to do her chores. She wasn't even frightened when she saw me... in an instant I think we had both fallen in love. I ended up living with that woman in that tiny little village for a year until she was with child. And then, like a coward... I ran away. I was a thief and I didn't want to end up a farmer. It was a terrible thing to do.\r\n\r\nI didn't have the courage to return to that village for almost fifteen years. When I finally decided to visit, it was too late. It had been raided by bandits and burned to the ground. Everyone was either dead or gone. Including you... my only child.\r\n\r\nYears later, when you were recruited by Brynjolf I couldn't believe my eyes. You're a spitting image of your mother and I knew it was you in an instant. Only the gods know how you survived the attack on that village and why you followed in my footsteps, but I have to assume it was meant to be. I've wanted to walk right up to you and embrace you, to tell you the truth, but I was still a coward. I decided to leave Riften instead of facing your anger. I said my goodbyes to Delvin and I headed for Solstheim... as far from the truth as I could get.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, my daughter. I'm sorry for never being there to hold you at night or to protect you from whatever hardships you endured. One day, I hope you'll make the journey to Solstheim and visit your father.\r\n\r\nGlover Mallory","string":"<font face='$HandwrittenFont'>\r\n我最親愛的女兒藍寶石：\r\n\r\n我以沉重的心情寫下這封信。多年來，我一直想著該如何告訴妳，我總以為我一定能當面跟妳說。對於我的所作所為，我感到無比羞愧，希望妳有朝一日能原諒我。但無論無何，請不要責怪戴爾文，他並不知情。\r\n\r\n在我加入公會多年以後，我被派去搶劫一列車隊，它們停在距離天際省邊境不遠的一個小農村。我提早了一天抵達，所以決定到農倉的豬圈裡過夜。隔天早上醒來，我看到一個美若天仙的女人走進穀倉準備工作。她看到我的時候，一點都不害怕……我直覺認為我們雙方一見鍾情。我跟那個女人同居，在那個小村落住了一年，然後她懷孕了。結果，我卻跑了……跟懦夫沒兩樣。我是個賊，我不想從此當個農夫，那實在太可怕了。\r\n\r\n我一直不敢回去那個村莊，就這樣過了快十五年。等我終於鼓起勇氣，卻太遲了。整個村莊遭強盜襲擊，被燒成一片焦土，村民不是死了就是失蹤。包括妳……我的獨生女。\r\n\r\n多年過去，妳加入布林喬夫時，我簡直不敢相信我的眼睛。妳根本是妳母親的翻版，我立刻知道就是妳。只有神知道妳究竟是怎麼活過那場村莊浩劫，妳又怎會追隨我的腳步，但我私心認為一切都是上天注定。我好想大步走上前，給妳一個擁抱，並告訴妳真相，可是我還是不敢。我決定離開裂谷城，免得必須面對妳的怒氣。我跟戴爾文道別，前往索瑟海姆……盡可能遠離真相。\r\n\r\n女兒，對不起。我很抱歉從未在夜晚抱著妳，或保護妳免於各種苦痛的折磨。希望有一天，妳願意啟程到索瑟海姆，拜訪妳的父親。\r\n\r\n葛羅文．馬洛里","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2TGLetter","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201DA1C|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<p align='center'><font face='$HandwrittenFont'><font size='25'>\r\n\r\n\r\nAny Soul Gem\r\n\r\nAlbino Spider Pod\r\n\r\n</font></p>\r\n","string":"<p align='center'><font face='$HandwrittenFont'><font size='25'>\r\n\r\n\r\n任何靈魂石\r\n\r\n白化蜘蛛卵囊\r\n\r\n</font></p>\r\n","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2ExpSpiderCrftBookMindControl","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0001A332|Skyrim.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Oghma Infinium","string":"無限智典","index":null,"editor_id":"DA04OghmaInfinium","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02032198|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Black Book","string":"黑暗經書","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2BlackBookGeneric","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02017072|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face='$HandwrittenFont'> <font size='17'>\r\n    I've only tried a few combinations, but things look promising.

He described an age long ago when dragons ruled over the whole world and were worshipped as gods by men. Presiding over this cult of dragon-worshippers were the Dragon Priests, powerful mages who could speak the dragon language and call upon the power of the thu'um, or Voice.\r\n\r\nAccording to the legend, one such Dragon Priest was seduced by a dark spirit named Herma-Mora, an unmistakable analogue for the Daedric prince Hermaeus Mora. Lured by promises of power, this treacherous priest secretly plotted against his dragon master.\r\n\r\nThe Traitor's plot was discovered by one of his contemporaries, another Dragon Priest whom legend named The Guardian. The two fought a mighty battle that lasted for days, each hurling terrible arcane energies and thu'um shouts at the other. \r\n\r\nSo great and terrible were the forces unleashed in this contest that Solstheim was torn apart from the mainland of Skyrim. Here, the myth clearly descends into the realm of pure fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe Guardian, whom the legend presents as a paragon of loyalty and nobility, finally defeats the despicable Traitor, who seems to represent all that is corrupt and evil in men. Their epic duel is clearly representative of a greater struggle between good and evil. Perhaps it is this timeless quality that has kept the tale alive for so long.\r\n\r\nUnlike many similar myths, the tale of the Guardian and the Traitor does not feature a suitably heroic ending. Herma-Mora snatches the Traitor away just as the Guardian is about to strike the killing blow.\r\n\r\nThe dragons appoint the Guardian ruler of Solstheim, but not before he is compelled to swear an oath of vigilance to watch for the Traitor's return. His reign is, by all accounts, a time of peace and prosperity for the people of the island, and he is remembered as a wise and just leader.\r\n\r\nNo further mention is made of the Traitor, but neither is he thought to be dead. The legend ends on a cautionary note that the people of Solstheim, the heirs of the Guardian, must remain wary, lest the dark influence of Herma-Mora, or even the Traitor himself, return someday.\r\n\r\nAlthough no physical clues exist now on Solstheim to suggest the presence of the dragon cult, is it hardly difficult to believe that it might once have flourished here. Perhaps some hidden tomb still waits to be discovered that will tell the truth of the tale.\r\n\r\nThere are other tantalizing clues, though perhaps these connections strain the bonds of credibility.

The fall of the Ministry of Truth was the last straw in the tottering support for the Temple's worship of Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec. With all three of the Tribunes now widely believed dead or disappeared, what had been a simmering schism within the ranks of the Temple priesthood burst into the open.\r\n\r\nWhile outsiders may never know the full tale of this internal struggle, when the smoke cleared a few years later, the former Dissident Priests were in full control of the Temple heirarchy, with Tribunal loyalists either purged or recanted. The so-called \"New Temple\" now declared the worship of the Tribunes a result of misguided teaching, blaming the mistakes on the former Tribunal. The Temple now taught that the daedra venerated by the Ashlander tribes (Azura, Mephala and Boethia) were the \"true way\" and should be revered by the Dunmer people. Fittingly, the daedra were named the \"Reclamations,\" as if they were reclaiming their status from the Tribunal.\r\n\r\nIn an elegant comprise, no doubt intended to reconcile the large majority of the Temple priesthood who were neither Dissidents nor fanatic Tribunal loyalists, Almalexia, Sotha Sil and Vivec were relegated to the status of \"saints,\" a traditional way to venerate the most honored Dunmer ancestors. This apparently satisfied enough of the existing priesthood that the New Temple was able to maintain at least a semblance of outward continuity.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the New Temple almost completely vindicated the previously persecuted Ashlanders, who had continued to worship the three daedra throughout the Tribunal's rule. The Ashlanders are now lauded as the keepers of the old ways and having \"true vision.\" It is now quite common for many of the Dunmer people to make the arduous pilgrimages into the ash wastes to seek the counsel of the Wise Women. These women have supposedly opened the eyes of those who they claim were \"blinded by the Tribunal,\" and directly connect the eruption of the Red Mountain and the Argonian invasion to the anger of the three daedra.\r\n\r\nHouse Indoril, whose fortunes were so entwined with the Tribunal Temple, suffered greatly from its fall. While House Indoril still technically exists, the priesthood of the Temple are now considered one and the same with House Indoril - those who become priests are now considered to have \"joined Indoril.\" The political power of the Indoril has thus passed entirely into the hands of the Temple (although members of the old House Indoril are still over-represented in the priesthood).\r\n\r\nThe rise of the New Temple has a number of interesting parallels with the rise of House Redoran - each filled the vacuum of power resulting from the crisis of Red Year. How durable these new arrangements will prove, religious and political, remains to be seen. The span of two centuries is quite brief in the long history of the ancient Dunmer people.","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n收復者：\r\n裁決者的沒落和新神殿的崛起\r\n\r\n\r\n瑞哈德的薩拉 \r\n著\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>維瓦克城的毀滅，以及其後第四紀元5年的紅山爆發，除了導致實質物體的毀壞，也對丹莫人的古老信仰造成極大衝擊。神殿對愛瑪蕾希雅、索薩．席和維瓦克的崇拜原本就有爭議，真理部的墜落則是毀滅它的最後一根稻草。如今大家都相信三位裁決者若非已經死亡，就是失蹤了，神殿祭司群醞釀已久的階級鬥爭至此公然爆發。\r\n\r\n外部人士也許永遠無法完整得知這內部爭鬥的來龍去脈，不過在火山爆發後幾年，煙塵逐漸散去之際，從前的異議祭司全權掌握了神殿的統治階級，忠於裁決者的人士若非被剷除，就是改變了信仰。如今所謂的「新神殿」宣告，對裁決者的崇敬是種誤導，並將之怪罪於舊時的裁決者。神殿如今宣導，灰燼人部落所崇拜的魔侯（阿祖拉、梅法拉和波耶西亞）才是「正統」，丹莫人應該崇敬他們。這些魔侯被稱作「收復者」，意思是他們已從裁決者手中取回地位。\r\n\r\n為了討好神殿那些既非異議份子也非裁決者狂熱支持者的多數祭司，愛瑪蕾希雅、索薩．席和維瓦克被謫貶為「聖徒」，這是對最崇高的丹莫祖先表達敬意的傳統手法。顯然這個手段成功滿足了夠多的現有祭司，新神殿因此得以營造出一脈延續的假象。\r\n\r\n新神殿的崛起，徹底讓過往在裁決者統治下因崇拜三魔侯而遭迫害的灰燼人翻身，如今他們被譽為傳統的保存者，且因為擁有「真知灼見」而備受讚揚。現在，丹莫人踏上朝聖之旅，歷經千辛萬苦抵達灰燼荒地尋求女智者的忠告，是很尋常的事。據稱，這些女人讓那些宣稱自己被裁決者蒙蔽了雙眼的人重見天日，而且把紅山爆發和亞龍人入侵，直接歸因於三魔侯的怒火。\r\n\r\n財富與裁決者神殿密不可分的因督利爾家族，因為神殿的沒落遭到重創。由於因督利爾家族技術上來說依然存在，如今神殿的祭司群被認為與因督利爾家族是為一體，那些成為祭司的人則被視為「加入因督利爾」。因督利爾家的政治權勢因此全盤移交到神殿手上，但其家族成員依然在祭司群擁有比較多的權力。\r\n\r\n新神殿的崛起和瑞多然家族的崛起有異曲同工之妙，兩者都填補了紅色年代危機所造成的權力真空。這些新的調整無論在信仰或政治，究竟能否承受得了考驗，依然有待觀察。綜觀丹莫人民的悠久歷史，兩個世紀相對而言其實算是短暫的。","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book2CommonTheReclamations","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02033154|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face=\"$HandwrittenFont\">\r\nI grow impatient with your lack of progress.

A few of my assistants were insisting that I was imagining things, but I dismissed them for their insolence. They won't be bothering anyone ever again.\r\n\r\nDay 55\r\nGeneral Carius awoke fully today. He bolted upright after my incantations and began staggering around like a blind man. He seemed to ignore my commands... in fact, hearing my voice seemed to increase his hostility. I was able to remove the heartstone before he became violent, but this isn't a result that I expected. Even though he's able to be awakened, I feel as though the real work has just begun.\r\n\r\nDay 59\r\nThe general is still unable or unwilling to listen to my commands.

As a boy, his gift for magic and artifice had been evident to his tutors. As a man, his skill surpassed them all. And finding nothing more to learn among his kin, he left wife and child, and set out to train under the elven masters.\r\n\r\nA year became two, then three. And when finally his path led him back to Saarthal, he found only ruins: for the elves had sacked the city, and all that lived there were dead or gone. Amid the ashes, in the smoldering ruins of his home, he swore a terrible oath of vengeance. And from that comes the name the legends give him: Ahzidal, the embittered destroyer.\r\n\r\nAlone, he could do nothing. And so, he bided his time, delving deeper into his art than any before him. From the Dwemer, he learned the seven natures of metal and how to harmonize them. From the Ayleids, the ancient runes and dawn-magic even the elves had begun to forget. Among Falmer and Chimer and Altmer he traveled, taking what he could from each, and all the while plotting how he might turn that knowledge against them.\r\n\r\nFinally, word reached him of Ysgramor and his Companions, newly-arrived from Atmora. For three days and nights, he rode north, and met them as they made landfall on the icy coast near the ruins of Saarthal, which the elves had fortified against them. He offered the Companions his service, and all he had produced in his years of labor. And with Atmoran steel imbued with his enchantments, the elves fell before them, and at last he had his revenge.\r\n\r\nBut he was not content. His craft had become his life, and his hunger for knowledge still gnawed at him, driving him to delve ever deeper. At long last, he exhausted the lore of the elves, but it was not enough. He sought the secrets of Dragon-runes, and won for himself a seat among their high priests, but it was not enough. And at length, he turned his gaze to the planes of Oblivion, and found there both power and madness.\r\n\r\nSome say he ventured there, never to return. Others, that he was betrayed by his fellow Dragon Priests, and killed, or driven into hiding in the ruins beneath his beloved Saarthal. Among the Skaal of Solstheim, it is said he fled to their island, and was sealed in the depths of Kolbjorn Barrow, together with the last of his relics.\r\n\r\nBut that is the tale, as it was told among the bards of Winterhold. Whatever the truth, the legend of Ahzidal was intended as a warning: in pursuit of perfection, one must take care that the pursuit itself does not become all-consuming.","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n阿季達的傳承\r\n\r\n哈倫德．灰袍\r\n著\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/I_letter.png'>在不知多久以前，當人類第一次踏足天際省，在薩瑟爾城出現了一位偉大的附魔師。當他還是個小男孩時，他在魔法和工藝方面的天賦便已展露無遺。等到長大成人，更是超越了他的所有導師。待他發現在自己的族類中已沒有更多可供學習的事物，他便毅然決然拋妻棄子，向一位精靈拜師學藝。\r\n\r\n一年、兩年、三年，時光不斷流逝。等他終於回到薩瑟爾城，眼前只剩一片廢墟。精靈洗劫了那座城市，所有當地的居民都已死亡或離去。站在仍殘留餘熱的往日家園殘骸之中，他立下毒誓定要復仇。從此之後，他就被賦予那個在傳說中用來稱呼他的名字——阿季達，意即苦難的破壞者。\r\n\r\n光憑一個人，他做不了什麼事情。因此，他不惜耗費大量時間，更努力地鑽研他的技藝。從鍛莫身上，他學到了金屬的七大特性，以及如何融合它們；從野精靈身上，他學到了連精靈們自己都即將遺忘的上古符文和暮光魔法。此外，他還混跡於伐莫、奇莫和高等精靈之中，學習他們的長處，並暗自計劃著當時機來臨，該如何用他們的知識反過來對付他們。\r\n\r\n最後，他聽說了來自阿特莫拉大陸的伊斯格拉謨率領戰友團抵達的消息。為此，他花了三天三夜，騎乘坐騎不眠不休地向北奔馳，最後終於見到這群剛自滿佈浮冰的沿岸登陸的人。當時他們就位於薩瑟爾城遺跡附近，而精靈們正聚集戰力準備迎擊。於是他自告奮勇協助戰友團，並提供他這些年來的作品。來自阿特莫拉大陸的鋼鐵在注入了他的附魔之後，精靈們完全無力招架，他終於成功地報了血海深仇。\r\n\r\n但光是如此他還不滿意。他的技藝已經成了他生命的意義，而他對知識的渴望也不斷地啃噬著他的心智，讓他越陷越深。很久以後，他窮究了一切精靈的學識，但那依然不夠。於是，他開始涉獵龍族符文，並為自己在最高階的祭司中贏得一席之地——可是這仍未能滿足他。最後，他將目光轉移到湮滅位面之中，在那裡找到了他所要的力量，卻也陷入了瘋狂。\r\n\r\n有人說，他踏進了湮滅，而且一去不返。其他人則表示他被同儕的龍祭司背叛，遭到殺害，又或被迫躲進他所鍾愛的薩瑟爾城底下的遺跡。至於在索瑟海姆的斯卡爾村當中，則流傳他逃到了那座島上，並和他最後的幾樣聖物一起被封在寇泊瓊石塚的深處。\r\n\r\n不過，這些終究只是冬堡的吟遊詩人口中傳唱的故事情節。無論真相為何，所有關於阿季達的傳說都揭示此一教訓：在追求完美的路上，得要當心別讓這份渴盼反撲，吞噬你的一切。\r\n","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book4RareAhzidalsDescent","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0203B53E|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Eydis's Journal","string":"愛迪斯的日記","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2dunFahlbtharzJournal02","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02026D55|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Recipe - Exploding Shock Spider","string":"配方 - 閃電爆蛛","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2ExpSpiderCrftBookShockBomb","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201DA11|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Recipe - Flame Cloaked Spider","string":"配方 - 焰罩蜘蛛","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2ExpSpiderCrftBookFireCloak","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02028262|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Bone, Part II","string":"骨頭，第二部","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book2CommonBonePartII","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201DA0F|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Recipe - Exploding Flame Spider","string":"配方 - 爆焰蜘蛛","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2ExpSpiderCrftBookFireBomb","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02027E4E|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Ildari's Journal, vol.

The memory did not trouble him unduly, but he did not want to hurt anyone again unless he had to.\r\n \r\n\r\nHouse couriers regularly brought Tay letters from Baynarah, still back in Sandil House on the island of Gorne. She might have gone to study at the Temple, she was certainly intelligent enough, but she chose not to. In a year or two at most, she would have to leave and assume her place in House Indoril, but she was not in a hurry. Tay welcomed the trivial gossipy news the letters brought, and responded back with news of his own studies and romances.\r\n \r\n\r\nIn his third month in Mournhold, he had already met a girl. She was also a student at the Temple, and her name was Acra. Tay wrote enthusiastically about her to Baynarah, describing her as having the mind of Sotha Sil, the wit of Vivec, and the beauty of Almalexia. Baynarah replied back merrily that if she had known how blasphemous students of the Temple were allowed to be, she might have become an initiate herself.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"You are very devoted to your cousin,\" Acra laughed when Tay showed her the letter. \"Am I looking at the last remains of a thwarted romance?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"She's lovely, but I never thought of her that way,\" Tay scoffed. \"Incest never particularly interested me.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Is she a very close cousin then?\" \r\n\r\n\r\nTay thought for a moment: \"I don't know. Truthfully, no one spoke much of either her parents or mine, so I really don't know how we were connected. They were casualties of the War of the Red Mountain, that I know, and it seemed to cast rather a pall on the adults' humor whenever we asked about her parents or mine. After a while, we stopped asking. But you're an Indoril too. Perhaps you're a closer cousin to me than Baynarah.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so,\" Acra smiled, rising from her chair. She uncoiled her hair, which had been pulled up in the formal arrangement reserved for well-born priestesses. As Tay watched transfigured, she removed the small brooch that fastened her robe to her shoulder cape. The soft silken fabric slipped down slowly, exposing her dark, slender body to him for the first time. \"If we are, does incest particularly interest you now?\"\r\n \r\n\r\nAs they made love, the Song began a slow, rhythmic ascension in Tay's head. The vision of Acra before him darkened and was replaced by images from his nightmares before returning again. When finally he collapsed, spent, the room seemed filled with the fiery red clouds of his dream, and the scream of the woman and her child facing death echoed in his head. He opened his eyes, and there was Acra, smiling at him. Tay kissed her, grateful to have her in his arms.\r\n \r\n\r\nFor the next two weeks, Tay and Acra were never far apart. Even when they were at study in opposite wings of the Temple, Tay thought of her, and somehow knew she was thinking of him. They would rush to be together afterwards, ravishing one another in his rooms every night, and in a private corner of the Temple garden every day.\r\n \r\n\r\nIt was while Tay was rushing to see his beloved one afternoon that the Song rose up in powerful strident tones at the approach of an old, ragged woman. He closed his eyes and tried to quiet it, but when he looked again at her purchasing corkbulb papyrus from a street vendor, he knew who she was. His old nursemaid from Gorne, Edebah. She who had abandoned him without even a farewell to join her family on the mainland.\r\n \r\n\r\nShe didn't see him, and as she passed down the street, Tay turned and began to follow. They walked through shadowy passageways into the very poorest part of the city, a quarter which was as alien to him as the wildest principality of Akavir. She unlocked a small wooden door on a street without a name, and he finally called out her name. She didn't turn, but when he followed, he found that the door had been left ajar.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe chamber was murky and damp like a cave. She stood facing him, her face even more wrinkled than he had remembered it, etched with lines of sorrow. He closed the door behind him, and she took his hand and kissed it.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"You are so tall and strong,\" Edebah said, beginning to weep. \"I should have killed myself before I let them take me away from you.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"How is your family?\" Tay asked coldly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"You are my only family,\" she whispered. \"The Indoril pigs forced me to leave, thrusting their blades in my face, when they discovered that I serve you and your family, not them. That bitch girl Baynarah saw me at a prayer of mourning.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"You're speaking like a madwoman,\" Tay sneered. \"How could you love me and my family, but hate the House Indoril? I am of the House Indoril.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"You are old enough to know the truth,\" Edebah said fiercely. Tay had bitterly joked about her madness, but he saw something close to it burning in her ancient eyes. \"You were not born of House Indoril; they brought you into their house after the War, like they and the other Houses brought in all the orphans. It was the only way they saw to erase history and remove all traces of their enemies, by raising their enemies as one of them.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nTay turned toward the door: \"I can see why you were taken away from Gorne, old woman. You are delusional.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" Edebah cried, rushing to a musty cabinet. She retrieved from it a glass globe that shimmered with a spectrum of color even in the chamber's gloom. \"Do you remember this? You slew that little boy Vaster because he possessed it, and I took it from your room because you were not ready to face the facts of your inheritance and responsibility then. Did you not wonder why this bauble drew you so?\"\r\n \r\n\r\nTay gasped, and though he did not want to, he said, \"I hear a Song sometimes.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"That is the Song of your ancestors, of your true family,\" she said, nodding. \"You must not fight it, for it is a song of destiny. It will lead you to do what must be done.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Shut up!\" Tay howled, \"Everything you say is a lie! You're insane!\" \r\n\r\n\r\nEdebah threw the globe to the ground with all her might, shattering it with a deafening retort. The shards melted into the air. All that was left was a small silver ring, simply wrought with a flat crown. The old woman quietly picked it up and handed it to him, while he stood with his back against the door, trembling.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"This is your inheritance, as the bearer of the Sixth House.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nThe ring's crown was meant for stamping and sealing official House proclamations. Tay had seen his uncle Triffith's similar ring, crested with the wing which was the seal of House Indoril. This ring was different, with an insect design which he remembered from the day when Kena Gafrisi had taught the House heraldry to Baynarah and him.\r\n \r\n\r\nIt was the symbol of the accursed House Dagoth. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Song took over all of Tay's senses. He heard its music, smelled its horror, tasted its sadness, felt its power, and the only thing he could see before him was the flames of its destruction. When he took the ring and placed it on his finger, his mind was not aware of what he was doing. Nor was Tay aware of anything but the Song when he removed his dagger from its sheath and thrust it into his old nursemaid's heart.\r\n \r\n\r\nTay did not even hear her final words, when Edebah fell bleeding to the ground, and groaned with a blood-streaked smile, \"Thank you.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen the veil of the Song lifted, Tay did not realize at first he was no longer dreaming. Before him had been flames, the very ones that destroyed the home of his birth, and flames were before him again. But they were flames from a fire he had struck outside the crumbling tenement that were already bursting through walls, consuming the body of his old nursemaid.\r\n \r\n\r\nTay fled through the streets as people began to call for the guards.

Boethiah talked like Trinimac for awhile then, and gathered enough people to listen to him. Boethiah showed them the lies of the et'Ada, the Aedra, and told them Trinimac was the biggest liar of all, saying all this with Trinimac's voice! Boethiah told the mass before him the Tri-Angled Truth. He showed them, with Mephala, the rules of Psijic Endeavor. He taught them how to build Houses, and what items they needed to bury in the Corners. He demonstrated the right way to wear their skin. He performed the way to walk to achieve an Exodus. Then Boethiah relieved himself of Trinimac right there on the ground before them to prove all the things he said were the truth.

All through the long, fast walk away from the gorge, through the woods, across the dry creek bed, he chatted merrily with Baynarah, fully aware that he had just committed murder.

He could not think of the boy's death, but Tay knew he was responsible.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"You're a mess!\" cried Aunt Ulliah the moment she saw the two children emerging from the woods onto the grounds of Sandil House. \"Where have you been?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Didn't Vaster already tell you?\" asked Tay. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe scene played itself out as Tay knew it would, every dancer in the Song performing their steps as choreographed. Aunt Ulliah saying that she had not seen Vaster. Baynarah, not yet frightened, making up an innocent lie about the threesome not having strayed far, saying he must have gotten lost. A slow but steady rhythm of panic intensifying as night began to fall, and Vaster had not yet returned. Baynarah and Tay tearfully (he was surprised how easy it was for him to cry without feeling) admitting where they had been, and leading Uncle Triffith and a crowd of servants to the junk pile and gorge. The tireless search through the woods as night turned to dawn. The weeping. The light punishment, merely cries of anger, that Baynarah and Tay suffered for losing their young cousin.\r\n \r\n\r\nIt was thought, from their stricken expressions, that the children felt guilty enough. They were sent to bed at dawn while the hunt through the woods continued.\r\n \r\n\r\nTay was drifting to sleep when his nursemaid Edebah came into his room. The look of unwavering love and devotion had not left her eyes, and he sank gratefully into his dreams and nightmares with her holding his hand. The Song wafted almost imperceptibly through his consciousness as he again had the vision of the room in the castle. The girl and her baby. The bird in the rafters. The dying fire. The sudden explosion of violence. Breathless, Tay opened his eyes.\r\n \r\n\r\nEdebah was stealing out the door, softly humming the Song to herself. In her hand was the crystal globe from his satchel. For a moment, he hesitated, about to cry out. How did she know the Song? Was she aware that he had murdered another boy to get the globe?\r\n \r\n\r\nSomehow he knew that she was helping him, that she knew all and loved him and sought only to protect him.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe next day, and the next week, and the next month were all the same. No one spoke very much, and when they did it was to suggest new places to look for the missing boy. Everywhere had been searched thoroughly. Tay was curious why they never looked in the gorge, but he understood how inaccessible it was.\r\n \r\n\r\nA side-effect of Vaster's absence was that the tutorial sessions with Kena Gafrisi took on a more serious, even academic quality. The younger boy's high spirits and meager attentiveness had always cut the lessons short, but sensible Baynarah and quiet Tay were ideal pupils. He was particularly impressed by how focused they became during a rather dry history lecture about the heraldic symbols of Houses of Morrowind.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"The crest of the Hlaalu features a scale,\" he sniffed disdainfully. \"They see themselves as the great compromisers, as if that were something honorable. Many hundreds of years ago, they were the tribesmen following Resdayn who chose--\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Kena,\" asked Baynarah. \"But what is the crest with the insect on it?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"You don't know House Redoran?\" asked the tutor, lifting up one of the shields. \"I know you have a sheltered life on Gorne, but you're surely old enough to recognize--\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Not that one, Kena,\" replied Tay. \"I think she means the other crest with an insect.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I see,\" nodded Kena Gafrisi, brow furrowed. \"Yes, you would be too young to have ever seen the crest of the Sixth House, the House of Dagoth. Our enemies together with the accursed heretical Dwemer in the War of the Red Mountain, now totally destroyed, thanks be to Lord, Mother, and Wizard. That House was a curse on our land for millennia, and when at last their pestilence was snuffed out, the very earth itself breathed a cloud of fire and ash in relief, bringing night to day for over a year's time.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nBaynarah and Tay knew they could not speak, but they exchanged knowing glances at one another as the tutor enlarged on the theme of the great wickedness of the Dwemer and the House Dagoth. As soon as the lesson ended, they walked silently out of Sandil House until they were far from all ears and eyes.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe afternoon sun stretched out the shadows of the spear-like trees surrounding the meadow. Off in the distance, they could hear the sounds of the workers beginning their preparations for the autumntide harvest, yelling to one another unintelligibly in coarse and familiar accents.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"That was definitely the symbol on that shield you found at the garbage heap,\" Baynarah said at last. \"Everything there must be a remnant of the House Dagoth.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nTay nodded. His mind was on the strange crystal globe. He felt a light vibration of soundless music touch his body, and knew he was discovering a new cadence of the Song.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Why would our people have burned and discarded all that?\" he asked thoughtfully. \"Do you think the House Dagoth was so evil that everything associated with them could have been cursed?\"\r\n \r\n\r\nBaynarah laughed. At the height of day, all talk of curses and the evil Sixth House were pure supposition: something to add romance to one's life, but nothing to worry about. The two children walked back to the castle for yet another in a series of cold, quiet dinners. As the night fell, Baynarah looked through the treasures she had picked up in the junk heap. By the light of the moons, the small jars, the torc with orange gemstones, the bits of tarnished silver and gold of no obvious purpose, all took on a sinister aspect.\r\n \r\n\r\nRevulsion overtook her feeling of admiration instantly. There was a strange energy to them, a tincture of death and corruption that was undeniable. Baynarah ran to the window and vomited.\r\n \r\n\r\nLooking out to the dark open lawn below, she saw a figure below lighting an arrangement of candles in the shape of a large insect, the symbol of the House Dagoth. When it looked in her direction, she pulled back, but she saw the face illuminated by the tallows. It was Edebah, Tay's nursemaid.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe next morning, Baynarah left the castle grounds early, bearing a large sack filled with her treasures. She carried them to the dumping ground and left them there. Then she returned, and told her Uncle Triffith what she had seen the night before, leaving out only what had made her sick in the first place.\r\n \r\n\r\nEdebah was banished from the isle of Gorne without discussion. She wept, begging to be allowed to say goodbye to Tay, but all believed that would be too dangerous. When Tay asked what had become of her, he was told she had to return to her family on the mainland. He had grown too old for a nursemaid.\r\n \r\n\r\nBaynarah never told him what she knew. For she was afraid.

In the Battle of Red Mountain, warriors of House Redoran died bravely for their duty to the Tribunal.

Following the Temple's guidelines of mercy and generosity show duty to one's family and clan.\r\n \r\n\r\nA Redoran noble must know the virtue of gravity. It is not the Redoran way to laugh at serious matters, for it shows disrespect. It is not the Redoran way to spread rumors, for they fester and breed dissention.\r\n \r\n\r\nA Redoran must show piety to the Aedra and Daedra, our creators and ancestors. For without the divine, we would not have the chance to serve. And without divine law, we would not know right from wrong. And without giving thanks for these things, we would forget out place and our purpose.\r\n \r\n\r\nGreat House Redoran praises all the skills of war. Not because we believe war is good or honorable in its own right, but because this knowledge is necessary to perform one's duty. House Redoran's warrior fight with a long blade and a shield or with a spear. A noble of House Redoran must also learn to use a bow and must be athletic enough for the long marches to battle. A Redoran wears heavy or medium armor depending on rank and strategy. A noble of House Redoran is expected to know how to repair and maintain his own armor.\r\n \r\n\r\nThose who are born to House Redoran have been taught their skill and virtues by kin and clan. Those who seek to enter House Redoran as retainers must satisfy an examiner in the Redoran Council Hall that their skills are suitable for service to House Redoran.\r\n \r\n\r\nWhether born to the blood of House Redoran, or adopted into service of House Redoran by oath, those who seek to advance in the ranks of House Redoran must demonstrate their virtues by service and obedience.

A different man might not have, I know that, and from time to time, I think back on the hour when I saw the gold and took it. You see, I was hungry. Isn't it ironic.\r\n \r\n\r\nI don't remember much else about that night but the gold and the hunger. I don't remember the name of the tavern, or even the village, but I believe it was somewhere in southern Vvardenfell. I can't really be certain. For some time, I sat dumbly in my chair, my mind occupied with nothing but the pain in my stomach. If you've never been truly hungry from days of no food, you can't know what it's like. You can't concentrate on anything. It wasn't until a figure to my left got up from the table to get a drink and left a stack of gold marks behind that I snapped to awareness.\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom this moment on, my memory is crystalline. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy eyes to the gold. My eyes to the stranger's back, walking calmly toward the barmaid. My hand to the gold. The gold in my pocket. I'm up from the table, and out the door. For just a moment, I look back. The stranger has turned to look my way. He wears a hood, but I can feel his eyes meet mine. I swear, I can scent a smile.\r\n \r\n\r\nOut into the street, and behind some barrels I crouched down, waiting for my pursuer. One benefit of a lifetime running from guards, I know how to disappear. For nearly an hour, I waited there, suffering even more from hunger. You see, I was awake now and I had the means to buy myself a feast. This knowledge tortured me. When I finally got to my feet, I very nearly fainted. I had only enough energy to walk to the other edge of the village to a run-down tavern before collapsing at a table. I think I must have fallen unconscious for a moment before I heard the barmaid's voice.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Can I get you something to eat, sera?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI gorged myself on roasts and pies and huge frothing mugs of greef. As the fog of near fatal starvation began to lift, I looked up from my plate to see a gold-masked stranger looking at me, his vizard glowing by the blinding light of the moon through the window. He wore black leather armor and was a different physique and size from the man I had burgled, but I could tell he knew. I paid for my meal quickly and left.\r\n \r\n\r\nI skirted the edge of the village, through a tiled central courtyard surrounded by the squalid peasant's cottages. There was not a light shining from any window or door. No one was on the streets. I could find no place to hide, so I took the road out of town, heading for the wilderness. Hunger had pushed me on in the days before, but now I felt what I imagined to be the whip of guilt. Or perhaps, even then, it was fear.\r\n \r\n\r\nI fell twice, rushing down the dark path, unused to the slopes and pebbled texture. The sounds of animal life, which I had numbed to, were suddenly very loud in my ears. And there was something else out there in the night, something chasing me.\r\n \r\n\r\nOn the side of the road, there was a low wall, and I scrambled over it and hid. I knew enough about concealment to pick a spot where the bulwark sunk slightly so even if someone saw the outline of my figure, he would assume it to be part of the wall. It wasn't long before I heard the sound of running footsteps from more than one person pass me by and then stop. There was a moment of whispered conversation, and one of the people ran back on the path toward the village. Then, silence.\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter a few more minutes, I peered out from behind the wall. A female figure in a dun gown, wimple, and veil stood in the road. On the other end of the road, blocking the way back to town, was a knight, coated in dark mail. I could see neither of their faces. For a moment, I froze, unsure whether either or both had seen me.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Run,\" said the woman in a dead voice. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe hill behind me was too steep, so I leapt over the wall and across the road in two bounds. Into the night forest I ran, the maddening jingle of the accursed gold in my pocket. I knew I was making so much noise my pursuers could not help but hear me, but now I cared more for putting distance between us than in stealth. Clouds of ash filtered through the moonlight, but I still knew it was too bright to hide. I ran and ran until I felt all my blood pumping in my head and heart, begging me to stop.\r\n \r\n\r\nI was at the edge of the wood, on the other side of a shallow stream from a vast, crumbling house encircled by a rail fence. Behind me, running footfall in the broken, dusty earth. To the south, downstream, a distinct sodden splashing of someone moving nearer.\r\n \r\n\r\nThere was no choice. I half jumped and half fell into the mud and dragged myself up the bank on the other side. I rolled under the fence and ran through the open field toward the house. Jerking my head around, I saw seven shadowy figures by the fence posts. The cloaked man I had robbed. The man in the gold mask. The veiled woman. The dark knight. Three others too who had pursued me, but I had never seen. And I thought I was the stealthy one.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe moon was entirely hidden in a swarm of ash. Only the stars offered their meager illumination as I reached the open door of the ruin. I slammed and bolted the door behind me, but I knew there could be no protection for very long. As I looked about the ravaged interior of broken furniture, I searched for someone to hide. A corner, a niche where if I stayed very still, no one would see me.\r\n \r\n\r\nA splintered table lying against the wall looked perfect for my purposes. I crawled under it, and jumped when something moved and I heard a frightened old man's voice.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Who's there?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It's all right,\" I whispered. \"I'm not one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHis puckered, gnarled hand reached out from the shadow and gripped my arm. Instantly, I felt sleep fall upon me, resist it as I might. The old man's horrible face, the face of the hungry dead, emerged as the moon came out and shone through the broken window. His talon still gripping me, I fell back, smelling his death surround me.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe table was thrown back. There stood the seven hunters and a dozen more. No, hunters they weren't. They were harriers who had chased me out of every hiding place, expertly pushing me to the lair of the real predator. He was weak with age, the old man was, not as good at the chase as once he was. A blunt, killing machine.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Please,\" I said. It was all I could muster. \r\n\r\n\r\nHaving enjoyed the sport I offered, he granted me mercy, of sorts. I was not bled dry. I was not cursed by being made one of them, the Berne. I was kept with others, most of us mad with fear, to be aged and tasted at the vampires' whim. We are called cattle.\r\n \r\n\r\nI lost all hope months ago of ever leaving the dank cellar where they keep us. Even if this note finds its way to the outside world, I cannot give enough information about my whereabouts to be rescued, even if some champion were able to defeat the bloodsuckers. I only write this to keep my own sanity, and to warn others.\r\n \r\n\r\nThere is something worse than being hungry. \r\n\r\n\r\nBeing food.

I sought first-hand accounts and personal views about the cataclysmic event. I felt that if I simply did the research in the library stacks at the College of Winterhold, I wasn't really telling the tale that needed to be told. What struck me as I moved from city to city, town to town, camp to camp is that all of the Dunmer I met shared an incredible bond of sheer courage and unshakable faith. So what began as a chronicle of one of the worst events in the history of Morrowind became something altogether different, the celebration of a people who can never be defeated.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\nDrallin Vess\r\nTear\r\n\r\n\"The ground... it just turned into mush. There was almost no warning. I mean, we were what... perhaps a mile from the nearest swamps? It was like the swamp suddenly swallowed up half of the city.\"\r\n\r\nI asked him to describe what happened from the beginning.\r\n\r\n\"I owned a farm just outside of Tear at the time. We were planting the next season's crops and getting ready to store what we had harvested. Everything was going well until the Red Mountain exploded. Almost immediately, the ground rumbled and shook. Cracks started forming everywhere and then the water just started seeping through. It was awful. In a matter of hours, I was knee-deep in swamp water running for my life. Where I was running, I had no idea. At first I ran towards the city itself, but it looked like the walls were cracking. All around me, people were desperately trying to save their livestock and their families from the rising water. Just when the ground shaking finally died down, and I had a moment to think, there was a horrible cracking noise. I'll never forget it, because I knew what it was before I looked. The entire southern wall of Tear collapsed sending guards tumbling into the swamp. I heard people screaming as they were covered by the rubble and forced down into the water. Forgetting my own problems, I looked over at my fellow farmers who were all staring at the carnage unfolding before us. Suddenly, we all just forgot our own problems and ran to help. There must have been hundreds of the poorer folks who lived outside the walls helping the richer ones who lived in the city. Never saw anything like that. I think we must have saved hundreds more that day.\"\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nNeria Relethyl\r\nGnisis\r\n\r\nNeria was badly burned by the eruption, and had trouble speaking to me. She is currently convalescing at the Temple of Azura in Blacklight even after all these years. I've tried to record her story to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\n\"It was such a terrible thing... the fire. It burned everything in its path. It flattened trees, turned our huts into splinters and knocked over towers like they were made from parchment. It all happened in an instant. A rumbling sound, then a massive wall of flame... it was so high it blocked out the sun. I thought that the world itself had split apart. It passed over the water and turned it to steam... vaporized everything it touched. When it finally hit us, I was blown off of my feet... didn't even have time to run away or seek shelter. I ended up in the riverbed next to town, which kept some of the flames off of me. All around... could smell the charred stench of death. There were Dunmer that were burned alive and some never even saw it coming. I lay in that riverbed for two days before the healers found me. When I could finally stand, Gnisis was gone.

Take for instance, the story I told you last night about my cousin. If he hadn't fallen off that horse, he never would have become one of the Empire's foremost alchemists.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nIt was late one Middas night at the King's Ham, and the regulars were always especially inclined toward philosophy.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I disagree,\" replied Xiomara, firmly but politely. \"Great ideas and inventions are most often formed slowly over time by diligence and hard work. If you'll recall my tale from last month, the young lady -- who I assure you is based on a real person -- only recognized her one true love after she had slept with practically everyone in Northpoint.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I put it to you that neither is the case,\" said Hallgerd, pouring a topper on his mug of greef. \"The greatest inventions are created by extraordinary need. Must I remind you of the story I told some time ago about Arslic Oan and the invention of bonemold?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"The problem with your theory is that your example is entirely fictional,\" sniffed Xiomara.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I don't believe I remember the story of Arslic Oan and the invention of bonemold,\" frowned Garaz. \"Are you sure you told us?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Well, this happened many, many, many years ago, when Vvardenfell was a beauteous green land, when Dunmer were Chimer and Dwemer and Nord lived together in relative peace when they weren't trying to kill one another,\" Hallgerd relaxed in his chair, warming to his theme. \"When the sun and moons all hung in the sky together--\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Lord, Mother, and Wizard!\" grumbled Xiomara. \"If I'm going to be forced to hear your ridiculous story again, pray don't embellish and make it any longer than it has to be.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nThis all happened in Vvardenfell quite some time ago (said Hallgerd, ignoring Xiomara's interruption with admirable restraint) during an era of a king you would never have heard of. Arslic Oan was one of this king's nobles and very, very disagreeable fellow. Because of his allegiance to the crown, the king had felt the need to grant him a castle and land, but he didn't necessarily want him as a neighbor so the land he granted was far from civilization. Right in an area of Vvardenfell that is, even today, not quite civilized to this day. Arslic Oan built a walled stronghold and settled down with his unhappy slaves to enjoy a quiet if somewhat grim life.\r\n \r\n\r\nIt was not long before his stronghold's integrity was tested. A tribe of cannibalistic Nords had been living in the valley for some time, mostly dining on one another, but occasionally foraging what they liked to call dark meat, the Dunmer.\r\n \r\n\r\nXiomara laughed with appreciation. \"Marvelous! I don't remember that from before. It's funny how you don't hear much about the Nords' rampant cannibalism nowadays.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nThis was obviously, as I've said, quite some time ago (said Hallgerd, glaring at part of his audience with civil malevolence) and things were in many ways quite different. These cannibalistic Nords began attacking Arslic Oan's slaves in the fields, and then slowly grew bolder, until they held the very stronghold itself under siege. They were quite a fearsome sight you can imagine: a horde of wild-eyed men and women with dagger-like teeth filed to tear flesh, wielding massive clubs, cloaked only in the skins of their victims.\r\n \r\n\r\nArslic Oan assumed that if he ignored them, they'd go away. \r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the first thing that the Nords did was to poison the stream that carried water into the walled stronghold. All the livestock and most of the slaves died very quickly before this was discovered. There was no hope of rescue, at least for several months when the king's emissaries would come reluctantly to visit the disagreeable vassal. The next closest source of water was on the other side of the hill, so Arslic Oan sent three of his slaves with empty jugs to bring some back.\r\n \r\n\r\nThey were beaten with clubs and eaten before they were a few feet outside the stronghold gates. The next group he sent through he gave sticks to defend themselves. They made it a few feet farther, but were also overwhelmed, beaten, and devoured. It was obvious that better personal defensive was required. Arslic Oan went to talk to his armorer, one of his few slaves with specific talents and duties.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"The slaves need armor if they're going to make it to the river and back,\" he said. \"Collect every scrap of steel and iron you can find, every hinge, knife, ring, cup, everything that isn't needed to keep the walls sturdy, smelt it, and give me the most and the best armor you can, very, very quickly.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nThe armorer, whose name was Gorkith, was used to Arslic Oan's demands, and knew that there could be no compromise on the quality and quantity of the armor, or the speed at which he worked. He labored for thirty hours without a break - and, recall, without any water to slake his thirst as he struggled with the kiln and anvil - until finally, he had six suits of mixed-metal armor.\r\n \r\n\r\nSix slaves were chosen, clad in the armor, and sent with jars to collect river water. At first, the mission progressed well. The Nord attacked the armored slaves with their clubs, but they continued their march forward, warding off the blows. Gradually, however, the slaves seemed to be walking uncertainly, dazed by the endless barrage. Eventually, one by one, they fell, the armor was peeled from their bodies, and they were eaten.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"The slaves couldn't move quickly enough in that heavy armor you made,\" said Arslic Oan to Gorkith. \"I need you to collect all the cadavers of the poisoned livestock, strip their skin, and give me the most and the best leather armor you can, very, very quickly.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nGorklith did as he was told, though it was a particularly repulsive task given the rancid state of the livestock. Normally it takes quite a time to treat and cure leather, so I understand, but Gorklith worked at it tirelessly, and in a half a day he had twelve suits of leather armor.\r\n \r\n\r\nTwelve slaves were chosen, clad in the armor, and sent with jars to collect river water. They progressed, at first, much better than the earlier expedition. Two fell almost immediately, but the others had some luck out-maneuvering their assailants while deflecting an occasional blow of the club. Several got to the river, three were able to fill up their jars, and one fellow very nearly made it back to the stronghold gates. Alas, he fell and was eaten. The Nords possessed a remarkably healthy appetite.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"What we need before I completely run out of slaves,\" said Arslic Oan thoughtfully to Gorkith. \"Is an armor sturdier than leather but lighter than metal.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nThe armorer had already considered that and taken stock of the materials available. He had thought about doing something with stone or wood, but there were practical problems with demolishing more of the stronghold. The next most prevalent stuff present in the stronghold was skinned dead bodies, hunks of muscle, fat, blood, and bone. For six hours, he toiled relentlessly until he produced eighteen suits of bonemold, the first ones ever created. Arslic Oan was somewhat dubious at the sight (and smell) but he was very thirsty, and willing to sacrifice another eighteen slaves if necessary.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Might I suggest,\" Gorklith queried tremulously, \"Having the slaves practice moving about in the armor, here in the courtyard, before sending them to face the Nords?\"\r\n \r\n\r\nArslic Oan coolly allowed it, and for a few hours, the slaves wandered about the stronghold courtyard in their suits of bonemold. They grew used to the give of the joints, the rigidity of the backplate, the weight pushed onto their shoulders and hips. They discovered how to plant their feet slightly askew to keep their balance steady; how to quickly turn, pivoting without falling down; how to break into a run and stop quickly. By the time they were sent out of the castle gates, they were easily very nearly almost amateurs in the use of their medium weight armor.\r\n \r\n\r\nSeventeen of them were killed and eaten, but one made it back with a jar of water.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"It's perfect nonsense,\" said Xiomara. \"But my point is still valid even so. Like all great inventors, even in fiction, the armorer worked diligently to create the bonemold.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I think there was a good deal of happenstance as well,\" frowned Garaz. \"But it is an appalling story. I wish you hadn't told me.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"If you think that's appalling,\" grinned Hallgerd. \"You should hear what happened next.\"\r\n ","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n骨頭，第一部 \r\n\r\n塔唯．卓米歐 \r\n著\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n\r\n葛拉茲若有所思地望入手中的飛令，說：「依我看，所有偉大的想法都是偶發的。例如，我昨晚說的我表弟的故事。他要不是剛好從馬背跌下來，永遠都不會成為帝國最重要的鍊金師。」\r\n\r\n\r\n這是在國王火腿的某個週三深夜，老主顧總是特別喜歡爭辯哲學問題。\r\n\r\n\r\n「我不同意，」休麥拉堅定有禮地回答。「偉大的想法和發明，經常是長時間勤奮與辛苦工作才緩慢形成的。如果大家還記得我上個月說的那位小姑娘，那個我保證是真人真事的故事，她確實是跟北角城幾乎每個男人都睡過之後，才認出她的唯一真愛。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「我說，你們這兩個想法都不對，」霍格德把他那杯葛福白蘭地加得更滿。「偉大的發明來自非凡的需要。難道你們忘了不久前我說過厄斯力．翁和骨模的故事嗎？」\r\n\r\n\r\n「你這理論最大的問題，就是你的例子全是虛構的，」休馬拉嗤之以鼻。\r\n \r\n\r\n「我還真的對厄斯力．翁和骨模的故事沒什麼印象，」葛拉茲皺起眉頭。「你確定你說過？」\r\n \r\n\r\n「嗯，它發生在許多、許多、許多年前，那時瓦登費爾還是一塊美麗的綠地，那時丹莫還叫奇莫，而鍛莫族跟諾德人依然和平相處，還沒互相殘殺，」霍格德放鬆地坐著，開始為他的主題暖身。「那時太陽和許多月亮還同時掛在天上——」\r\n \r\n\r\n「上主、神母和巫師！」休馬拉發起牢騷。「如果我必須被迫再聽一次你的荒謬故事，拜託你省下那些修飾，開門見山地說吧。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n故事發生在瓦登費爾（霍格德以可佩的自制力沒理會休馬拉的打岔），一個你們沒聽過的王朝。厄斯力．翁是國王的朝臣之一，是個非常、非常不討人喜歡的傢伙。因為他對王室的擁戴，國王覺得有必要賞賜他城堡和土地，但又不想跟他成為鄰居，所以賜給他的封地遠離文明，就在即使是如今也還不是很文明的瓦登費爾。厄斯力．翁建造了高牆環繞的堡壘，帶著他那些不快樂的奴隸住了下來，開始享受或許有些嚴酷但很平靜的生活。\r\n\r\n\r\n他的堡壘是否堅固，很快就面臨了考驗。一群諾德食人族早已久居山谷，他們通常是以自己人為食，但偶爾也會去劫掠他們稱為「黑肉」的丹莫人來一飽口福。\r\n\r\n\r\n休馬拉激賞地大笑。「說得好！這些我都忘記了。現在真的很難得聽到這些殘暴的諾德食人族故事。」\r\n\r\n\r\n正如我所說，這顯然是很久以前的事（霍格德繼續，略微義憤填膺地瞪了他的某位聽眾一眼），現在很多事情都不一樣了。吃人的諾德族開始攻擊在田裡工作的奴隸，他們逐漸地越來越大膽，最後甚至包圍了堡壘。你不難想像他們看起來有多麼可怕：一群眼神狂野的男女，露出用來撕肉、如匕首般的鋒利牙齒，他們揮舞著巨大的木棒，身上除了受害者的皮別無他物。\r\n\r\n\r\n厄斯力．翁本來以為只要不理他們，他們就會離開。\r\n\r\n\r\n不幸的是，諾德人反而先在流入堡壘的溪中下毒。在事情被揭發前，所有家畜和大多數的奴隸已經迅速死亡。他們沒有任何支援，就算是奉國王之命來探視這位討厭諸侯的特使，也要幾個月之後才會到。次近的水源在山的另一邊，於是厄斯力．翁派出三個帶著空壺的奴隸，要他們去取些水回來。\r\n\r\n\r\n他們剛出堡壘沒走多遠，就被亂棒打死、生吞入腹了。他又派出第二批人，讓他們帶著木棍自衛，他們確實多走了幾步，但還是以寡敵眾，被打死然後吞下肚。顯然，他們需要更有力的個人防備措施。厄斯力．翁因此去找他的護甲師，他是少數有特殊天分和職責的奴隸之一。\r\n\r\n\r\n「取水的奴隸必須有盔甲，」他說。「收集你能找到的所有鋼和鐵，那些絞鍊、刀子、戒指、杯子，只要不能用於鞏固城牆，就把它們熔掉，做出最堅固而且最好的盔甲，你的時間不多。」\r\n\r\n\r\n這個名叫葛奇仕的護甲師已經很習慣厄斯力．翁的要求，知道主人對品質、數量和速度的要求是絕對不容妥協的。他不眠不休地工作了三十個小時——請記住，他是在火爐及鐵砧旁邊趕工，而且沒有水得以解渴——最後，他做好了六套綜合金屬的盔甲。\r\n \r\n\r\n六名被選中的奴隸穿上盔甲，奉派去取水。起初，任務還算順利。諾德人用木棒攻擊穿著盔甲的奴隸，但他們擋開打擊繼續前進。然而奴隸們逐漸被密集的攻擊弄得不知方向，最後一個個跌倒，盔甲被剝除，他們也被吃掉了。\r\n\r\n\r\n「你做的盔甲太重了，奴隸跑不快，」厄斯力．翁對葛奇仕說。「我要你收集所有被毒死家畜的屍體，剝掉牠們的皮，給我最多最好的皮革盔甲，越快越好。」\r\n\r\n\r\n葛奇仕聽令而行，雖然腐臭的屍體讓這任務顯得無比可怕。就我所知，處理皮革需要好些時間，但葛奇仕勤奮地工作，半天就做好十二套皮革盔甲。\r\n\r\n\r\n十二名被選中的奴隸穿上盔甲，奉派去取水。起初，他們的進度明顯比前一批探險隊更好。雖有兩人才出門就被打倒，但其他人比敵方技高一籌，躲過一些木棒的攻擊。幾個人順利抵達水邊，三個人裝了水，其中一個幾乎回到堡壘的大門。然而，他最後還是倒下，被吃掉了。諾德人的胃口實在驚人。\r\n\r\n\r\n「我們快沒有奴隸了。」厄斯力．翁深思熟慮之後，對葛奇仕說：「我們需要的是比皮革堅固，但比金屬輕巧的盔甲。」\r\n\r\n\r\n護甲師早就思考過這件事，也多方考量各種可用的現成材料。他想過石頭或木材，但那會削弱堡壘的防衛。次多的素材是還有皮膚的死屍，成堆成塊的肌肉、脂肪、血和骨頭。他又毫不懈怠地苦幹了六個小時，做出十八套骨模，這是前所未見的創舉。厄斯力．翁起先對於成品的外觀和氣味充滿懷疑，但他實在太渴了，若得再犧牲十八個奴隸也在所不惜。\r\n\r\n\r\n葛奇仕用發抖的聲音請求：「可否在派他們出去面對諾德人之前，先讓他們穿著盔甲在院子裡練習怎麼行動？」\r\n\r\n\r\n厄斯力．翁冷冷地答應了。奴隸穿著骨模在堡壘的院子活動了幾個小時，逐漸習慣關節的靈活限度、僵硬的背板，以及盔甲壓在肩膀和髖部的重量。他們也發現把腳步稍微外八較能保持平衡，學會怎樣迅速轉身而不跌倒，以及如何在快跑時煞住腳步。他們奉派走出堡壘時，已能靈活操作中等重量的盔甲。\r\n\r\n\r\n十七個奴隸被殺死吃掉，但有一個成功帶著水回來。\r\n\r\n\r\n「這故事太荒謬了，」休馬拉說。「即使如此，我的論點依然成立。就算只是虛構人物，這位護甲師也跟所有偉大的發明家一樣，是因為勤奮不懈的工作才創造出骨模。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「我認為偶發的成分也很大，」葛拉茲皺著眉頭。「不過這故事太可怕了，真希望你沒說。」\r\n \r\n\r\n霍格德咧著嘴笑。「更恐怖的，你還沒聽到呢。」","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book2CommonBonePartI","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0203AF1C|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\nThe History of Raven Rock\r\nVolume II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby\r\nLyrin Telleno\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\nForward\r\n\r\nRaven Rock is one of the more interesting colonies of Morrowind of the last two centuries. So much has happened to this tiny town in such a short amount of time, and so many lives have been affected by it, I felt it necessary to describe its rich history within these volumes. During my research, I lived in Raven Rock for almost three years, and I got to know many of my fellow Dunmer who call Raven Rock their home. I hope that my readers will appreciate the amount of fortitude and perseverance that it must take to endure life in such an inhospitable and untamed land.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/A_letter.png'>fter a few years, the relentless ash storms from the ever-erupting Red Mountain had transformed Solstheim's southern reaches into pure ash wastes reminiscent of those present on Vvardenfell itself. The storms would leave behind deep dunes of ash that made life exceedingly difficult in Raven Rock. In order to protect the town from these drifts, Brara Morvayn proposed that the East Empire Company construct a large wall of her own design to protect the east end of town. The company quickly agreed and provided the necessary funds. After almost a year, the construction was complete and the huge edifice was named \"The Bulwark.\" The wall proved to be extremely effective and allowed work to continue unabated in the mines.\r\n\r\nIn 4E 16, when Solstheim was passed into the hands of the Dunmer people, the East Empire Company was forced to relinquish Raven Rock's control to House Redoran. The Council quickly named Brara Morvayn as councilor of their new town, and allowed her to rule Solstheim as she saw fit. As a result of this changing of the guard, almost the entire Imperial population left Raven Rock and returned to Cyrodiil. Brara continued to welcome the Dunmer that elected to settle on Solstheim. Some chose to stay in Raven Rock to work in the mines, and other took to more familiar territory and began a nomadic lifestyle in the ash wastes.\r\n\r\nThe next few decades were the golden years for Raven Rock. Brara Morvayn was keeping the peace, the mines were still producing large quantities of ebony and the Dunmer that lived on the island were happy. After almost fifty years of prosperity, in 4E 65, Brara Morvayn finally succumbed to old age and passed away.

The omission of any reference to the worships of the Argonians of Black Marsh is a result of my complete inadequacy in reconciling the obscure and contradictory accounts available to me on that subject.\r\n \r\n\r\nTHE EIGHT PANTHEONS \r\n\r\n\r\nCYRODIIL: Akatosh, Dibella, Arkay, Zenithar, Mara, Stendarr, Kynareth, Julianos, Shezarr, Tiber Septim, Morihaus, Reman\r\n \r\n\r\nSKYRIM: Alduin, Dibella, Orkey, Tsun, Mara, Stuhn, Kyne, Jhunal, Shor, Ysmir, Herma-Mora, Maloch\r\n \r\n\r\nALTMER: Auri-El, Trinimac, Magnus, Syrabane, Y'ffre, Xarxes, Mara, Stendarr, Lorkhan, Phynaster\r\n \r\n\r\nBOSMER: Auri-El, Y'ffre, Arkay, Z'en, Xarxes, Baan Dar, Mara, Stendarr, Lorkhan, Herma-Mora, Jone, Jode\r\n \r\n\r\nDUNMER: Almalexia, Vivec, Sotha Sil, Boethiah, Mephala, Azura, Lorkhan, Nerevar, Molag Bal, Malacath, Sheogorath, Mehrunes Dagon\r\n \r\n\r\nYOKUDA: Satakal, Ruptga, Tu'whacca, Zeht, Morwha, Tava, Malooc, Diagna, Sep, HoonDing, Leki, Onsi,\r\n \r\n\r\nBRETONY: Akatosh, Magnus, Y'ffre, Dibella, Arkay, Zenithar, Mara, Stendarr, Kynareth, Julianos, Sheor, Phynaster\r\n \r\n\r\nELSWEYR: Alkosh, Khenarthi, Riddle'Thar, ja-Kha'jay, Mara, S'rendarr, Lorkhaj, Rajhin, Baan Dar, Azurah, Sheggorath\r\n \r\n\r\nNOTES ON THE DIVINE SPIRITS OF THE PANTHEONS \r\n\r\n\r\nAkatosh (Dragon God of Time): Akatosh is the chief deity of the Nine Divines (the major religious cult of Cyrodiil and its provinces), and one of two deities found in every Tamrielic religion (the other is Lorkhan). He is generally considered to be the first of the Gods to form in the Beginning Place; after his establishment, other spirits found the process of being easier and the various pantheons of the world emerged. He is the ultimate God of the Cyrodilic Empire, where he embodies the qualities of endurance, invincibility, and everlasting legitimacy.\r\n \r\n\r\nAlduin (World Eater): Alduin is the Nordic variation of Akatosh, and only superficially resembles his counterpart in the Nine Divines. For example, Alduin's sobriquet, 'the world eater', comes from myths that depict him as the horrible, ravaging firestorm that destroyed the last world to begin this one. Nords therefore see the god of time as both creator and harbinger of the apocalypse. He is not the chief of the Nordic pantheon (in fact, that pantheon has no chief; see Shor, below) but its wellspring, albeit a grim and frightening one.\r\n \r\n\r\nAlkosh (Dragon King of Cats): Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anaquinine deity. A variation on the Altmeri Auri-El, and thus an Akatosh-as-culture-hero for the earliest Khajiiti. His worship was co-opted during the establishment of the Riddle-T'har, and he still enjoys immense popularity in Elsweyr's wasteland regions. He is depicted as a fearsome dragon, a creature the Khajiit say 'is just a real big cat'. He repelled an early Aldmeri pogrom of Pelinal Whitestrake during mythic times.\r\n \r\n\r\nAlmalexia (Mother Morrowind): Most traces of Akatosh disappeared from ancient Chimer legends during their so-called 'exodus', primarily due to that god's association and esteem with the Altmeri. However, most aspects of Akatosh which seem so important to the mortal races, namely immortality, historicity, and genealogy, have conveniently resurfaced in Almalexia, the most popular of Morrowind's divine Tribunal.\r\n \r\n\r\nArkay (God of the Cycle of Life and Death): Member of the Nine Divines pantheon, and popular elsewhere as well. Arkay is often more important in those cultures where his father, Akatosh, is either less related to time or where his time aspects are difficult to comprehend by the layman. He is the god of burials and funeral rites, and is sometimes associated with the seasons. His priests are staunch opponents of necromancy and all forms of the undead. It is said that Arkay did not exist before the world was created by the gods under Lorkhan's supervision/urging/trickery. Therefore, he is sometimes called the Mortals' God.\r\n \r\n\r\nAuri-El (King of the Aldmer): The Elven Akatosh is Auri-El. Auri-El is the soul of Anui-El, who, in turn, is the soul of Anu the Everything. He is the chief of most Aldmeri pantheons. Most Altmeri and Bosmeri claim direct descent from Auri-El. In his only known moment of weakness, he agreed to take his part in the creation of the mortal plane, that act which forever sundered the Elves from the spirit worlds of eternity. To make up for it, Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the armies of Lorkhan in mythic times, vanquishing that tyrant and establishing the first kingdoms of the Altmer, Altmora and Old Ehlnofey. He then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.\r\n \r\n\r\nAzura (Goddess of Dusk and Dawn): Azura was the god-ancestor that taught the Chimer the mysteries needed to be different than the Altmer. Some of her more conventional teachings are sometimes attributed to Boethiah. In the stories, Azura is often more a communal cosmic force for the race as a whole than an ancestor or a god. Also known as the Anticipation of Sotha Sil. In Elsweyr, Azurah is nearly a wholly separate entity, yet she is still tied into the origins of Khajiiti out of Altmeri stock.\r\n \r\n\r\nBaan Dar (The Bandit God): In most regions, Baan Dar is a marginal diety, a trickster spirit of thieves and beggars. In Elsweyr he is more important, and is regarded as the Pariah. In this aspect, Baan Dar becomes the cleverness or desperate genius of the long-suffering Khajiit, whose last minute plans always upset the machinations of their (Elven or Human) enemies.\r\n \r\n\r\nBoethiah (Prince of Plots): Heralded by the Prophet Veloth, Boethiah is the original god-ancestor of the Dark Elves. Through his illuminations, the eventual 'Chimer', or Changed Folk, renounced all ties to the Aldmer and founded a new nation based on Daedric principles. All manner of Dark Elven cultural 'advances' are attributed to Boethiah, from philosophy to magic to 'responsible' architecture. Ancient Velothi allegories are uniformly heroic successes of Boethiah over enemies of every type, foundation stories of Chimeri struggle. Also known as the Anticipation of Almalexia.\r\n \r\n\r\nDiagna (Orichalc God of the Sideways Blade): Hoary thuggish cult of the Redguards. Originated in Yokuda during the Twenty Seven Snake Folk Slaughter. Diagna was an avatar of the HoonDing (the Yokudan God of Make Way, see below) that achieved permanence. He was instrumental to the defeat of the Lefthanded Elves, as he brought orichalc weapons to the Yokudan people to win the fight. In Tamriel, he led a very tight knit group of followers against the Orcs of Orsinium during the height of their ancient power, but then faded into obscurity. He is now little more than a local power spirit of the Dragontail mountains.\r\n \r\n\r\nDibella (Goddess of Beauty): Popular god of the Nine Divines. In Cyrodiil, she has nearly a dozen different cults, some devoted to women, some to artists and aesthetics, and others to erotic instruction.\r\n \r\n\r\nHerma-Mora (The Woodland Man): Ancient Atmoran demon who, at one time, nearly seduced the Nords into becoming Aldmer. Most Ysgramor myths are about escaping the wiles of old Herma-Mora. Also called the Demon of Knowledge, he is vaguely related to the cult origins of the Morag Tong ('Foresters Guild'), if only by association with his brother/sister, Mephala.\r\n \r\n\r\nHoonDing (The Make Way God): Yokudan spirit of 'perseverance over infidels'. The HoonDing has historically materialized whenever the Redguards need to 'make way' for their people. In Tamrielic history this has only happened three times -- twice in the first era during the Ra Gada invasion and once during the Tiber War. In this last incarnation, the HoonDing was said to have been either a sword or a crown, or both.\r\n \r\n\r\nJhunal (Rune God): The Nordic god of hermetic orders. After falling out of favor with the rest of that pantheon, he became Julianos of the Nine Divines. He is absent in modern Skyrim mythology.\r\n \r\n\r\nJode (Big Moon God): Aldmeri god of the Big Moon. Also called Masser or Mara's Tear. In Khajiti religion, Jode is only one aspect of the Lunar Lattice, or ja-Kha'jay.\r\n \r\n\r\nJone (Little Moon God): Aldmeri god of the Little Moon. Also called Secunda or Stendarr's Sorrow. In Khajiti religion, Jone is only one aspect of the Lunar Lattice, or ja-Kha'jay.\r\n \r\n\r\nJulianos (God of Wisdom and Logic): Often associated with Jhunal, the Nordic father of language and mathematics, Julianos is the Cyrodilic god of literature, law, history, and contradiction. Monastic orders founded by Tiber Septim and dedicated to Julianos are the keepers of the Elder Scrolls.\r\n \r\n\r\nKyne (Kiss At the End): Nordic Goddess of the Storm. Widow of Shor and favored god of warriors. She is often called the Mother of Men. Her daughters taught the first Nords the use of the thu'um, or Storm Voice.\r\n \r\n\r\nKynareth (Goddess of Air): Kynareth is a member of the Nine Divines, the strongest of the Sky spirits. In some legends, she is the first to agree to Lorkhan's plan to invent the mortal plane, and provides the space for its creation in the void. She is also associated with rain, a phenomenon said not to occur before the removal of Lorkhan's divine spark.\r\n \r\n\r\nLeki (Saint of the Spirit Sword): Goddess daughter of Tall Papa, Leki is the goddess of aberrant swordsmanship. The Na-Totambu of Yokuda warred to a standstill during the mythic era to decide who would lead the charge against the Lefthanded Elves. Their swordmasters, though, were so skilled in the Best Known Cuts as to be matched evenly. Leki introduced the Ephemeral Feint. Afterwards, a victor emerged and the war with the Aldmer began.\r\n \r\n\r\nLorkhan (The Missing God): This Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri 'Lorkhan', or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane, upsetting the status quo -- much like his father Padomay had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the et'Ada. He and his metaphysical placement in the 'scheme of things' is interpreted a variety of ways. In Morrowind, for example, he is a being related to the Psijiic Endeavor, a process by which mortals are charged with transcending the gods that created them. To the High Elves, he is the most unholy of all higher powers, as he forever broke their connection to the spirit plane. In the legends, he is almost always an enemy of the Aldmer and, therefore, a hero of early Mankind.\r\n \r\n\r\nLorkhaj (Moon Beast): Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anaquinine deity, easily identified with the Missing God, Lorkhan.\r\n \r\n\r\nMagnus (Magus): The god of sorcery, Magnus withdrew from the creation of the world at the last second, though it cost him dearly. What is left of him on the world is felt and controlled by mortals as magic. One story says that, while the idea was thought up by Lorkhan, it was Magnus who created the schematics and diagrams needed to construct the mortal plane. He is sometimes represented by an astrolabe, a telescope, or, more commonly, a staff. Cyrodilic legends say he can inhabit the bodies of powerful magicians and lend them his power. Associated with Zurin Arctus, the Underking.\r\n \r\n\r\nMalacath (God of Curses): Malacath is the reanimated dung that was Trinimac. A somewhat weak but vengeful Daedra, the Dark Elves say he is also Malak, the god-king of the orcs. He always tests the Dunmer for physical weakness.\r\n \r\n\r\nMalooc (Horde King): An enemy god of the Ra Gada. Led the goblins against the Redguards during the first era. Fled east when the army of the HoonDing overtook his goblin hordes.\r\n \r\n\r\nMauloch (Malacath): An Orcish god, Mauloch troubled the heirs of King Harald for a long time. Fled east after his defeat at the Battle of Dragon Wall, ca. 1E660. His rage was said to fill the sky with his sulphurous hatred, later called the \"Year of Winter in Summer\".\r\n \r\n\r\nMara (Goddess of Love): Nearly universal goddess. Origins started in mythic times as a fertility goddess. In Skyrim, Mara is a handmaiden of Kyne. In the Empire, she is Mother-Goddess. She is sometimes associated with Nir of the 'Anuad', the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. Depending on the religion, she is either married to Akatosh or Lorkhan, or the concubine of both.\r\n \r\n\r\nMehrunes Dagon (God of Destruction): Popular Daedric power. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. In some cultures, though, Dagon is merely a god of bloodshed and betrayal. He is an especially important deity in Morrowind, where he represents its near-inhospitable terrain.\r\n \r\n\r\nMephala (Androgyne): Mephala is the Webspinner, or the Spider God. In Morrowind, he/she was the ancestor that taught the Chimer the skills they would need to evade their enemies or to kill them with secret murder. Enemies were numerous in those days since the Chimer were a small faction. He/she, along with Boethiah, organized the clan systems that eventually became the basis for the Great Houses. He/she founded the Morag Tong. Also called the Anticipation of Vivec.\r\n \r\n\r\nMolag Bal (God of Schemes, King of Rape): Daedric power of much importance in Morrowind. There, he is always the archenemy of Boethiah, the Prince of Plots. He is the main source of the obstacles to the Dunmer (and preceding Chimer) people. In the legends, Molag Bal always tries to upset the bloodlines of Houses or otherwise ruin Dunmeri 'purity'. A race of supermonsters, said to live in Molag Amur, are the result of his seduction of Vivec during the previous era.\r\n \r\n\r\nMorihaus (First Breath of Man): Ancient cultural hero god of the Cyro-Nordics. Legend portrays him as the Taker of the Citadel, an act of mythic times that established Human control over the Valley Heartland. He is often associated with the Nordic powers of thu'um, and therefore with Kynareth.\r\n \r\n\r\nMorwha (Teat God): Yokudan fertility goddess. Fundamental deity in the Yokudan pantheon, and the favorite of Tall Papa's wives. Still worshipped in various areas of Hammerfell, including Stros M'kai. Morwha is always portrayed as four-armed, so that she can 'grab more husbands'.\r\n \r\n\r\nNerevar (Godkiller): The Chimeri king of Resdayn, the Golden Age of old Veloth. Slain during the Battle of Red Mountain, Nerevar was the Herald of the Triune Way, and is the foremost of the saints of Dunmeri faith. He is said to have killed Dumac, the Last Dwarven King, and feasted on his heart.\r\n \r\n\r\nOnsi (Boneshaver): Notable warrior god of the Yokudan Ra Gada, Onsi taught Mankind how to pull their knives into swords.\r\n \r\n\r\nOrkey (Old Knocker): A loan-god of the Nords, who seem to have taken up his worship during Aldmeri rule of Atmora. Nords believe they once lived as long as Elves until Orkey appeared; through heathen trickery, he fooled them into a bargain that 'bound them to the count of winters'. At one time, legends say, Nords only had a lifespan of six years due to Orkey's foul magic. Shor showed up, though, and, through unknown means, removed the curse, throwing most of it onto the nearby Orcs.\r\n \r\n\r\nPhynaster: Hero-god of the Summerset Isles, who taught the Altmer how to naturally live another hundred years by using a shorter walking stride.\r\n \r\n\r\nRajhin (Footpad): Thief god of the Khajiiti, who grew up in the Black Kiergo section of Senchal. The most famous burglar in Elsweyr's history, Rajhin is said to have stolen a tattoo from the neck of Empress Kintyra as she slept.\r\n \r\n\r\nReman (The Cyrodiil): Culture god-hero of the Second Empire, Reman was the greatest hero of the Akaviri Trouble. Indeed, he convinced the invaders to help him build his own empire, and conquered all of Tamriel except for Morrowind. He instituted the rites of becoming Emperor, which included the ritual geas to the Amulet of Kings, a soulgem of immense power. His Dynasty was ended by the Dunmeri Morag Tong at the end of the first era. Also called the Worldly God.\r\n \r\n\r\nRiddle'Thar (Two-Moons Dance): The cosmic order deity of the Khajiiti, the Riddle'Thar was revealed to Elsweyr by the prophet Rid-Thar-ri'Datta, the Mane. The Riddle'Thar is more a set of guidelines by which to live than a single entity, but some of his avatars like to appear as humble messengers of the gods. Also known as the Sugar God.\r\n \r\n\r\nRuptga (Tall Papa): Chief deity of the Yokudan pantheon. Ruptga, more commonly 'Tall Papa', was the first god to figure out how to survive the Hunger of Satakal. Following his lead, the other gods learned the 'Walkabout', or a process by which they can persist beyond one lifetime. Tall Papa set the stars in the sky to show lesser spirits how to do this, too. When there were too many spirits to keep track of, though, Ruptga created a helper out the dead skin of past worlds. This helper is Sep (see below), who later creates the world of mortals.\r\n \r\n\r\nSatakal (The Worldskin): Yokudan god of everything. A fusion of the concepts of Anu and Padomay. Basically, Satakal is much like the Nordic Alduin, who destroys one world to begin the next. In Yokudan mythology, Satakal had done (and still does) this many times over, a cycle which prompted the birth of spirits that could survive the transition. These spirits ultimately become the Yokudan pantheon. Popular god of the Alik'r nomads.\r\n \r\n\r\nSheogorath (The Mad God): The fearful obeisance of Sheogorath is widespread, and is found in most Tamrielic quarters. Contemporary sources indicate that his roots are in Aldmeri creation stories; therein, he is 'born' when Lorkhan's divine spark is removed. One crucial myth calls him the 'Sithis-shaped hole' of the world.\r\n \r\n\r\nSheor (Bad Man): In Bretony, the Bad Man is the source of all strife. He seems to have started as the god of crop failure, but most modern theologians agree that he is a demonized version of the Nordic Shor, born during the dark years after the fall of Saarthal.\r\n \r\n\r\nSep (The Snake): Yokudan version of Lorkhan. Sep is born when Tall Papa creates someone to help him regulate the spirit trade. Sep, though, is driven crazy by the hunger of Satakal, and he convinces some of the gods to help him make an easier alternative to the Walkabout. This, of course, is the world as we know it, and the spirits who followed Sep become trapped here, to live out their lives as mortals. Sep is punished by Tall Papa for his transgressions, but his hunger lives on as a void in the stars, a 'non-space' that tries to upset mortal entry into the Far Shores.\r\n \r\n\r\nShezarr (God of Man): Cyrodilic version of Lorkhan, whose importance suffers when Akatosh comes to the fore of Imperial (really, Alessian) religion. Shezarr was the spirit behind all human undertaking, especially against Aldmeri aggression. He is sometimes associated with the founding of the first Cyrodilic battlemages. In the present age of racial tolerance, Shezarr is all but forgotten.\r\n \r\n\r\nShor (God of the Underworld): Nordic version of Lorkhan, who takes sides with Men after the creation of the world. Foreign gods (i.e., Elven ones) conspire against him and bring about his defeat, dooming him to the underworld. Atmoran myths depict him as a bloodthirsty warrior king who leads the Nords to victory over their Aldmeri oppressors time and again. Before his doom, Shor was the chief of the gods. Sometimes also called Children's God (see Orkey, above).\r\n \r\n\r\nSotha Sil (Mystery of Morrowind): God of the Dunmer, Sotha Sil is the least known of the divine Tribunal. He is said to be reshaping the world from his hidden, clockwork city.\r\n \r\n\r\nStendarr (God of Mercy): God of the Nine Divines, Stendarr has evolved from his Nordic origins into a deity of compassion or, sometimes, righteous rule. He is said to have accompanied Tiber Septim in his later years. In early Altmeri legends, Stendarr is the apologist of Men.\r\n \r\n\r\nStuhn (God of Ransom): Nordic precursor to Stendarr, brother of Tsun. Shield-thane of Shor, Stuhn was a warrior god that fought against the Aldmeri pantheon. He showed Men how to take, and the benefits of taking, prisoners of war.\r\n \r\n\r\nSyrabane (Warlock's God): An Aldmeri god-ancestor of magic, Syrabane aided Bendu Olo in the Fall of the Sload. Through judicious use of his magical ring, Syrabane saved many from the scourge of the Thrassian Plague. He is also called the Apprentices' God, for he is a favorite of the younger members of the Mages Guild.\r\n \r\n\r\nTava (Bird God): Yokudan spirit of the air. Tava is most famous for leading the Yokudans to the isle of Herne after the destruction of their homeland. She has since become assimilated into the mythology of Kynareth. She is still very popular in Hammerfell among sailors, and her shrines can be found in most port cities.\r\n \r\n\r\nTiber Septim (Talos, the Dragonborn): Heir to the Seat of Sundered Kings, Tiber Septim is the most important hero-god of Mankind. He conquered all of Tamriel and ushered in the Third Era (and the Third Empire). Also called Ysmir, 'Dragon of the North'.\r\n \r\n\r\nTrinimac: Strong god of the early Aldmer, in some places more popular than Auri-El. He was a warrior spirit of the original Elven tribes that led armies against the Men. Boethiah is said to have assumed his shape (in some stories, he even eats Trinimac) so that he could convince a throng of Aldmer to listen to him, which led to their eventual Chimeri conversion. He vanishes from the mythic stage after this, to return as the dread Malacath (Altmeri propaganda portrays this as the dangers of Dunmeri influence).\r\n \r\n\r\nTsun: Extinct Nordic god of trials against adversity. Died defending Shor from foreign gods.\r\n \r\n\r\nTu'whacca (Tricky God): Yokudan god of souls. Tu'whacca, before the creation of the world, was the god of Nobody Really Cares. When Tall Papa undertook the creation of the Walkabout, Tu'whacca found a purpose; he became the caretaker of the Far Shores, and continues to help Redguards find their way into the afterlife. His cult is sometimes associated with Arkay in the more cosmopolitan regions of Hammerfell.\r\n \r\n\r\nVivec (Master of Morrowind): Warrior-poet god of the Dunmer. Vivec is the invisible keeper of the holy land, ever vigilant against the dark gods of the Volcano. He/she has saved the Dunmeri people from certain death on numerous occasions, most notably when he/she taught them how to breathe water for a day so that he/she could flood Morrowind and kill the Akaviri invaders, ca. 2E572.\r\n \r\n\r\nXarxes: Xarxes is the god of ancestry and secret knowledge. He began as a scribe to Auri-El, and has kept track of all Aldmeri accomplishments, large and small, since the beginning of time. He created his wife, Oghma, from his favorite moments in history.\r\n \r\n\r\nY'ffre (God of the Forest): Most important deity of the Bosmeri pantheon. While Auri-El Time Dragon might be the king of the gods, the Bosmer revere Y'ffre as the spirit of 'the now'. According to the Wood Elves, after the creation of the mortal plane everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into the first of the Ehlnofey, or 'Earth Bones'. After these laws of nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, because they could finally understand it. Y'ffre is sometimes called the Storyteller, for the lessons he taught the first Bosmer. Some Bosmer still possess the knowledge of the chaos times, which they can use to great effect (the Wild Hunt).\r\n \r\n\r\nYsmir (Dragon of the North): The Nordic aspect of Talos. He withstood the power of the Greybeards' voices long enough to hear their prophecy. Later, many Nords could not look on him without seeing a dragon.\r\n \r\n\r\nZ'en (God of Toil): Bosmeri god of payment in kind. Studies indicate origins in both Argonian and Akaviri mythologies, perhaps introduced into Valenwood by Kothringi sailors. Ostensibly an agriculture deity, Z'en sometimes proves to be an entity of a much higher cosmic order. His worship died out shortly after the Knhaten Flu.\r\n \r\n\r\nZeht (God of Farms): Yokudan god of agriculture. Renounced his father after the world was created, which is why Tall Papa makes it so hard to grow food.\r\n \r\n\r\nZenithar (God of Work and Commerce, Trader God): Member of the Nine Divines, Zenithar is understandably associated with Z'en. In the Empire, however, he is a far more cultivated god of merchants and middle nobility.

的能力相提並論，因而和凱娜瑞絲有所關聯。\r\n\r\n\r\n莫娃（乳頭之神）：猶庫達的豐饒女神。猶庫達眾神的主要神祇，至高之父妻子們的最愛。在落錘省不同地區，含斯圖爾斯．麥凱島，依然廣受崇拜。莫娃的形象總是四隻手臂，好讓她可以「抓住更多丈夫」。\r\n\r\n\r\n尼瑞瓦（弒神者）：奇莫的瑞斯登之王，古梅洛特的黃金年代。尼瑞瓦在紅山之役遭弒，是三位一體的報信者，也是丹莫信仰中最重要的先聖。據說他殺了最後的矮人王杜馬克，並大啖其心臟。\r\n\r\n\r\n翁席（削骨者）：猶庫達鐳蓋達的知名戰士之神，翁席教導人類如何把刀放進劍中。\r\n\r\n\r\n奧奇（老混蛋）：借自諾德的神祇，在傲爾特莫統治阿特莫拉期間，取得其受人崇拜地位。在奧奇出現之前，諾德人相信他們的生存年代和精靈一樣久遠；奧奇以異教徒的詭計，欺騙他們同意一個「把自己困在終年寒冬」的協議。傳說記載，因為奧奇的下流魔法，諾德人一度只有六年的壽命。不過朔爾現身，以未知的方法移除了這個詛咒，將大部分的法力轉給附近的獸人。\r\n\r\n\r\n費拿司特：夏暮島的英雄神祇，他教導傲爾特莫縮小步伐，自然而然繼續存活幾百年。\r\n\r\n\r\n拉席（攔路大盜）：他成長於三敲港的黑其爾溝區，是虎人的小偷之神。身為艾斯維爾省史上最知名的竊賊，據說拉席曾在琴蒂拉女皇睡著時，盜走她脖子上的刺青。\r\n\r\n\r\n雷曼（賽瑞迪爾英雄）：雷曼是阿卡維爾之禍的大英雄，為第二帝國的文化英雄神祇。他說服入侵者幫他建立自己的王國，並征服了晨風省除泰姆瑞爾以外的所有地方。他制定皇帝的加冕儀式，其中包含戴上力量強大的靈魂石諸王護符。他的朝代終結於第一紀元末的丹莫族魔拉格堂手中。別稱俗世之神。\r\n\r\n\r\n瑞德-沙爾（雙月起舞）：虎人的宇宙秩序神祇，由身為鬃毛的先知利德-沙爾-瑞達塔將之揭露於世。瑞德-沙爾更近似一套生存方針而非單一個體，不過有些他的化身傾向以神祇謙恭使者的形象出現。亦有糖神之稱。\r\n\r\n\r\n盧部加（至高之父）：猶庫達諸神之首。盧部加，更以「至高之父」為人所知，是首位找出如何活過「沙塔喀之飢」方法的神祇。在他的帶領下，其他神祇學會「流浪回歸」，也就是能超脫壽命的過程。至高之父更以漫天繁星為標示指引其他靈魂一條明路。不過當太多靈魂循此道獲得永生後，盧部加便用過去世界脫下的死皮創造了助手賽普（請見以下），也就是之後創造了凡人世界者。\r\n\r\n\r\n沙塔喀（世界之皮）：猶庫達的萬物之神，為奧努和帕都枚的形象融合。沙塔喀跟諾德神祇奧杜因非常相似，兩者皆摧毀了一個世界以開創另一個新世界。在猶庫達神話中，沙塔喀已經如此做過（而至今依然未罷手）無數次，這個循環促使活過災難的靈魂新生。這些靈魂最終成為猶庫達眾神。廣受阿利克爾的遊牧民族歡迎。\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n謝爾格拉（瘋狂之王）：對謝爾格拉的極度敬畏幾乎橫掃泰姆瑞爾。當代資料指出，謝爾格拉的源起可以追溯回傲爾特莫的創世故事；故事中，當洛克汗的神聖電擊移除之際，謝爾格拉「誕生」。一則重要神話稱他是「西帝斯打的洞」。\r\n\r\n\r\n舒奧爾（惡棍）：在布萊頓，惡棍是所有衝突的來源。他原本似乎是作物歉收之神，但現今神學研究者認為他是諾德神祇朔爾的魔化版本，誕生於薩瑟爾毀滅後的黑暗時期。\r\n\r\n\r\n賽普（巨蛇）：猶庫達版本的洛克汗。賽普誕生的起因為至高之父創造幫手協助他管理靈魂數量。然而，賽普卻因承受不住沙塔喀之飢而發狂，他慫恿其他神祇幫他想出更簡單的方法。這就是我們所知的世界，那些跟隨賽普的靈魂被困在此，轉為凡人。至高之父為賽普的罪過懲罰他，但他的飢餓感依然常在，成為星空中的虛無，一個試圖干擾凡人前往遠岸的「真空」。\r\n\r\n\r\n謝紮爾（人類之神）：賽瑞迪爾版本的洛克汗，其重要性在阿卡托什進入帝國（確切而言，是艾麗西亞）宗教時備受威脅。謝紮爾是所有人類工作的守護靈，尤其致力於對抗傲爾特莫的入侵。有時人們會將他與首位賽瑞迪爾戰鬥法師的設立連想在一起。在現今種族寬容環境中，謝紮爾幾乎已遭遺忘。\r\n\r\n\r\n朔爾（冥界之神）：諾德版本的洛克汗，在世界創造之後，他選擇跟人類同一陣線。外族神（即精靈族的神祇）共謀與他對抗，將他打敗並貶入冥界。阿特莫拉神話將他描述為嗜血的戰士君王，率領諾德打敗長期壓迫他們的傲爾特莫。毀滅之前，朔爾是眾神之王。有時候他也被稱為孩童之神（請見上方的奧奇）\r\n\r\n\r\n索薩．席（晨風之秘）：丹莫神祇，是神聖裁決者中知名度最低者。據說他從其隱密的發條之城重塑世界。\r\n\r\n\r\n斯坦德爾（仁慈之神）：斯坦德爾從其諾德根基逐漸發展為同情或公正的神祇，為九聖靈之一。據說泰伯．塞普汀晚年時，他常伴左右。在早期傲爾特莫傳說中，斯坦德爾是人類的辯護者。\r\n\r\n\r\n斯圖恩（贖金之神）：諾德文化中，斯坦德爾的前輩、蘇恩的兄弟。身為朔爾的貼身武衛，斯圖恩是對抗傲爾特莫眾神的戰士之神。他教導人類如何索取，以及從戰俘身上撈得好處。\r\n\r\n\r\n錫賴班恩（巫師之神）：錫賴班恩幫助班度．歐洛對抗蛞蝓人，為傲爾特莫的魔法祖神。他明智使用其魔法戒指，拯救許多人免於沙斯瘟疫。他也被稱為學徒之神，因為他廣受法師公會年輕成員的喜愛。\r\n\r\n\r\n塔薇（飛鳥之神）：猶庫達的大氣神靈。塔薇最著名的事蹟，就是在猶庫達人民的家鄉毀滅後，帶領他們前往赫尼島。此後她與凱娜瑞絲的神話就此同化。她在落錘省的水手之間廣受歡迎，多數港口城市都能看到她的祭壇。\r\n\r\n\r\n泰伯．塞普汀（塔洛斯、龍裔）：泰伯．塞普汀是人類最重要的英雄神祇，為破裂君王王座的承襲者。他征服整塊泰姆瑞爾大陸，開創第三紀元（以及第三帝國）。他也被稱為伊斯米爾，即「北方之龍」。\r\n\r\n\r\n崔尼馬克：早期傲爾特莫的強悍神祇，在某些地區其受歡迎程度甚至凌駕於奧瑞-艾爾。他是初始精靈部落的戰士之神，率軍與人類對戰。據說波耶西亞僭取了他的形體（有些故事甚至說他吃了崔尼馬克），以取信於傲爾特莫群眾，讓他們聽他所言，最終讓他們轉變為奇莫人。之後他消失於神話的舞台，再以可怕的瑪拉凱斯身分重現（傲爾特莫將此視為丹莫影響力所蘊含的危險性）。\r\n\r\n\r\n蘇恩：滅亡的諾德逆境考驗之神。在捍衛朔爾抵抗外族神的鬥爭中身亡。\r\n\r\n\r\n圖瓦卡（巧計之神）：猶庫達的靈魂之神。在世界創造之前，圖瓦卡默默無名。當至高之父進行流浪回歸時，圖瓦卡找到了目標；他成為遠岸的管理人，並持續幫助紅衛人前往來生。在廣義的落錘省地區，對他的崇拜有時與阿爾凱混為一談。\r\n\r\n\r\n維瓦克（晨風之主）：丹莫的戰士詩人神祇。維瓦克是聖地的隱形守護者，警惕著紅山的黑暗神祇。他/她曾多次拯救丹莫人民免於死亡，最為人所知的是約第二紀元572年，他/她教他們如何在水中呼吸，然後以洪水淹沒晨風省，殺死阿卡維爾的入侵者。\r\n\r\n\r\n沙克斯：沙克斯是祖先和秘聞之神。起初他是奧瑞-艾爾的抄經者，記錄了自有時間那刻起，所有傲爾特莫的大小功績。他從自己最喜歡的歷史片刻中創造了他的妻子歐格瑪。\r\n\r\n\r\n葉飛爾（森林之神）：波茲莫眾神中最重要的神祇。時間之龍奧瑞-艾爾或許是眾神之王，但波茲莫尊崇葉飛爾為「現在」之靈。根據木精靈的紀錄，凡人世界創造以後，一切仍然混亂。最初的凡人被轉變成動物與植物，然後葉飛爾將自己化為最初的傲諾腓，即「大地骨骼」。待自然界的秩序確立，新世界中的芸芸眾生終於理解了萬物運行的道理，因而顯得安全無憂。葉飛爾有時也被稱作說書人，因為他傳授學問給最初的波茲莫人。有些波茲莫依然保有混亂時期的知識，而他們可以將之善用於「野性狩獵」。\r\n\r\n\r\n伊斯米爾（北方之龍）：塔洛斯的諾德版本。因為長期抵抗灰鬍子的龍吼，因而可以聽取他們的預言。之後，許多諾德人都會在他身上看到龍的影子。\r\n\r\n\r\n贊恩（辛勞之神）：波茲莫的善報之神。研究指出，贊恩出自亞龍和阿卡維爾的神話，然後可能經由寇辛吉水手傳入威木省。贊恩具農業神祇形象，有時甚至可以將他擴大解釋為宇宙秩序。肯哈登流感之後，他的信眾逐漸消失。\r\n\r\n\r\n齊特（農地之神）：猶庫達的農業之神。在世界創造之後，他與父親斷絕關係，這也是為何至高之父讓糧食非常難以種植的原因。\r\n\r\n\r\n澤尼薩爾（工作與商業之神，貿易之神）：澤尼薩爾和贊恩有明顯交集，為九聖靈之一。不過在帝國，他卻是商人和中產階級的神祇，帶有栽培事物的性質。他的信眾說，儘管起源成謎，澤尼薩爾卻是「不敗之神」。","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book3ValuableVarietiesofFaithintheEmpire","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02016E2D|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK

It concerned some minutiae of theosophy that she did not believe in, but nevertheless found morbidly compelling. When the door opened and she heard Tay enter, she finished the paragraph she was reading before looking up.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I've been here for hours, darling. If I knew you were going to be so late, I would have brought more books,\" she giggled. When she saw Tay's face and the state of his clothing, her manner lost all frivolity. \"What happened to you? Are you all right?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I've been to see my old childhood nursemaid, Edebah,\" he said in a strange voice. \"It was a sudden change of plans. I hadn't realized she was in Mournhold.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I wish I had known where you were going,\" she said, rising slowly from her chair. \"I would have loved to have met her.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Well, it's too late now.

She told me I was the bearer of the inheritance, and the Song I hear all the time in my head, the one that called me to kill another boy when I was young, and then Edebah herself, is the Song of my ancestors.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nTay fell silent. Acra knelt by his side, stroking his ringed hand. \"Tell me more.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"My tutor Kena Gafrisi taught us that the House Dagoth was a curse on Morrowind. He said that when they were all destroyed at the end of the War, the very earth itself breathed in relief,\" Tay closed his eyes. \"I can see the obliteration. I can even hear it in the Song. Edebah told me that the five Houses adopted the orphan children of Dagoth, raising them in their own traditions. I thought she was mad or a liar, but the real lie was all those years I thought my family was House Indoril.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" Acra whispered. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, Edebah told me to follow the Song to my destiny,\" Tay laughed bitterly. \"But the Song led me to kill her, so I don't know if she'd still give me that recommendation now. I know that I need to leave Mournhold. Before I knew what I was doing, I set a fire in her tenement. The guards were called. I just don't know where I'd go.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"You have many friends to shield you if you prove yourself to be the new leader of the return of the Sixth House,\" Acra kissed the ring. \"I will help you find them.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nTay stared at her. \"Why would you help me?\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"When you thought I was your cousin of the House Indoril, you did not mind having me though it might well have been incestuous,\" Acra replied, meeting his eyes. \"I have heard the Song too. It is not as strong with me as it was with you, but I never chose to ignore it. It taught me more than the ridiculous Temple priests and priestesses ever could. I knew that my true name was Dagoth-Acra, and I knew that I had a brother.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"No,\" Tay said through gritted teeth. \"You're lying.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"You are Dagoth-Tython.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nTay shoved Acra hard against the wall and ran from the room. As he fled through the hall, he heard the sound of Kalkorith's footfall on the stairs behind him, a percussive instrument in the Song that was rising in his heart and head\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Cousin,\" the senior initiate was saying. \"Have you heard about the fire--\" \r\n\r\n\r\nTay unsheathed his dagger and turned, burying it to the hilt in Kalkorith's throat. \"Cousin,\" he hissed. \"I am not your cousin.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nThe streets of Mournhold were lit by the red glow of the tenement fire, spreading through the tight alleyways by a steady and intense gust of wind. It was as if Dagoth-Ur himself was looming over the city, fanning the flames his heir had struck. A House guard, running toward the blaze, stopped at the sight of Tay, standing uncertainly, swaying, before the front door of Kalkorith's house, a bloodied blade in his hand.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"What you done, serjo?\" \r\n\r\n\r\nTay ran for the forest, his cape whipping behind him by the force of the howling wind. The guard clambered after him, sword drawn. He had no need to investigate the house to see the murder. He knew.\r\n \r\n\r\nFor hours, Tay raced through the wilderness, the Song pushing him onward. The sound of his pursuer faded away. At last, the trees thinned, and he saw nothing before him but air and water. A cliff, a hundred foot long plunge into the Inner Sea.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Song told him no. It pulled him north, sweetly promising a place to rest among friends. More than friends -- people who would worship him as the heir of Dagoth. As he slowly walked toward the edge of the cliff, the Song became more threatening, warning him not to seek to avoid his fate. There was no escape in death.\r\n \r\n\r\nTay spat a curse upon his House and threw himself head first over the cliff. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt was another glorious day on the island of Gorne, the first one in weeks that Baynarah could truly enjoy. Uncle Triffith had important company, Housemen from far away, and she had been required to attend every dinner, every meeting, every ceremony. As a child, she remembered, she had hoped for some attention. Now nothing was more blissful than time away from her duties.\r\n \r\n\r\nThere was only one thing she wanted to do that she had to do indoors, and that was writing a letter to her cousin. But that could wait until the evening, she told herself. After all, he had not written her in many days. It was the influence of that girl, Acra. Not that she seemed disagreeable, but Baynarah knew how one's first love can be all-consuming. At least, she had read about it.\r\n \r\n\r\nAs she walked idly through the wildflower meadow, Baynarah was so distracted with her thoughts that she did not hear her maid Hillima calling. She was quite startled when she turned to see the young servant running up.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Serjo,\" she said, breathlessly. \"Please come! Someone has washed up on the shore! It's your cousin, Serjo Indoril-Tay!\"\r\n ","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n毒藥之頌\r\n第四冊\r\n\r\n畢斯汀．謝爾 \r\n著\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/A_letter.png'>雅可拉坐在泰伊房內的火爐旁，就著火光閱讀。書的內容涉及一些她並不認同的神智學細節，不過其觀點倒是頗具說服力。門打開時，她聽到泰伊走進房間，她先把書看一段落，才抬起頭。\r\n\r\n\r\n「我來好幾個小時了，親愛的。如果我知道你這麼晚才會回來，我就會多帶幾本書，」她咯咯笑道。等她看到泰伊的臉還有衣服，她的輕佻態度立刻煙消雲散。 「發生了什麼事？你還好嗎？」\r\n\r\n\r\n「我去見了我兒時的保母艾蒂芭，」他的聲音很奇怪。「那不在計劃之內。我不知道她在哀傷之城。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「真希望我知道你要去哪裡，」她慢慢從椅子站起來。「我很想見見她呢。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「嗯，來不及了。我把她給殺了。」\r\n\r\n\r\n雅可拉深吸一口氣，審視泰伊面無表情的臉。她握住他的手。「也許你應該把事情經過說給我聽。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊讓他的摯愛領他來到火爐邊坐下，對著爐火猛眨眼。他低頭看著手指上的戒子。「在我動手前，她給了我這個。這是達格斯家的封印戒指。她說我是那個家族的傳人，而總在我腦袋裡迴盪的那首歌，曾在我小時候指使我殺害另一個男孩，現在又要我殺掉艾蒂芭，那是我的先祖之歌。」\r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊沉默下來。雅可拉跪在他的身邊，撫摸他戴著戒指的手。「再多說一點。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「我的家庭老師基納．嘉甫希曾告訴我們，達格斯家族是晨風省的詛咒。他說當戰爭結束他們被全數殲滅時，就連大地也鬆了口氣，」泰伊閉上眼睛。「抹滅大計就擺在我眼前，甚至能在那首歌中聽到。艾蒂芭跟我說，五個家族分別領養了達格斯的孤兒，按他們的傳統將他們養大成人。我以為她不是瘋了就是個大騙子，沒想到真正的謊言，是這麼多年來我一直當自己是因督利爾的一員。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「你打算怎麼做？」雅可拉悄聲說。\r\n\r\n\r\n「艾蒂芭叫我聽從歌曲，它會帶我走向我的命運，」泰伊苦澀地笑。「可是那首歌讓我殺了她，要是她還活著，我懷疑她會不會給我其他建議。我知道我得離開哀傷之城。在我意識到自己做了什麼之前，我放火燒了她的住處，有人通知了衛兵。但我不知道該何去何從。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「如果你證明自己是第六家族復興的新領袖，就會有很多盟友伸出援手，」雅可拉親吻戒指。「我會幫你找到他們。」\r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊瞪著她。「妳為什麼要幫我？」\r\n\r\n\r\n「你猜測我可能是你的因督利爾血親時，亂倫的可能性並未阻止你要我，」雅可拉直視他的眼睛。「我也會聽到那首歌。我聽到的歌聲不若你的洪亮，但我從來不曾忽視它。它教我的遠比這些可笑的神殿祭司多得多。我知道我真正的名字是達格斯．雅可拉，而且我有一個哥哥。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「不可能，」泰伊咬牙切齒地說。「妳騙人。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「你是達格斯．泰伊松。」\r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊用力把雅可拉往牆壁推去，然後衝出房間。在他飛奔而過大廳時，他聽到身後出現凱寇里斯踩在樓梯上的腳步聲，彷彿那首歌中的衝擊樂段，襲上他的心臟和腦袋。\r\n\r\n\r\n「堂弟，」凱寇里斯說著。「你有沒有聽說火——」\r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊抽出匕首轉身，一把架在凱寇里斯的喉嚨底。「堂弟，」他嘶聲說。「我不是你的堂弟。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n穩定強勁的狂風將小房間的火焰吹過狹小巷弄，哀傷之城的街道被那熊熊火光照得通紅。那情景彷彿達格斯．烏爾本人呼嘯而過城市，替他的繼承人火上加油。一個正往火焰跑去的房屋衛兵，在泰伊面前停下。他猶豫不決地站在凱寇里斯門前，身體搖晃，手中握著染血的小刀。\r\n\r\n\r\n「先生，你做了什麼？」\r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊往樹林奔去，他的斗篷被咆哮狂風捲起，在身後不停拍打。那個衛兵緊追其後，劍已出鞘。他不需要進屋內確認是否有謀殺。他很清楚。 \r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊在野地間跑了好幾小時，那首歌催促他前進。他的追兵漸漸聽不到了。終於，樹木稀疏了，眼前只剩一片汪洋。百呎高的峭壁插入裡海。\r\n\r\n\r\n那首歌阻止他，要他往北走，溫柔地保證那兒會有盟友，而他終將得以休息。那些人不只是朋友，他們將擁戴他，認他為達格斯的繼承者。在他慢慢靠近崖邊之際，那首歌開始流露威嚇，警告他不得逃避命運。死亡不是最終的解脫。\r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊詛咒他的家族，而後頭下腳上躍下峭壁。\r\n\r\n\r\n那是葛尼島上另一個美麗的好日子，幾星期以來，蓓娜拉第一次感到真正愉快。 崔斐斯叔叔有遠道而來的重要賓客，而她被要求出席每一場餐會、每一場會議、每一場儀式。她記得小時候，曾經希望可以獲得多一點注意。可是現在，能夠遠離她的職責簡直就是天賜的福氣。\r\n\r\n\r\n她只想做一件事，這件事必須在室內進行，就是寫信給她的堂弟。但是寫信可以等到晚上，她跟自己說。畢竟他已經好幾天沒有來信了。都是因為那個叫雅可拉的女孩。蓓娜拉倒不會看雅可拉不順眼，她也知道初戀的威力可以多麼強大。至少，她曾在書上讀過。\r\n\r\n\r\n蓓娜拉閒散地穿過長滿野花的牧草地，滿腹心事的她根本沒聽到女僕喜莉瑪的呼喊。等她轉身看到年輕女僕跑上前時，扎扎實實地嚇了一跳。\r\n\r\n\r\n「小姐，」她喘著氣說。「快過來！有人被沖上岸了！是妳的堂弟因督利爾．泰伊！」","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book1CheapPoisonSong4","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"020331C2|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face=\"$HandwrittenFont\">\r\nBoard the vessel Northern Maiden docked at Raven Rock.

His grandfather had served under Haknir, nigh on sixty years before, and even then he was a legend among the pirates of the north. \"The King of Ghosts,\" they called him, as eternal and pitiless as the sea he sailed. To Garuk, who had seen him charge into battle, clad in armor of gleaming Stalhrim like the kings of old, his twin swords scything men like grass, Haknir was practically a god.\r\n\r\nBut none feared Haknir more than his own crew. They knew his rages, his fits of madness, how he delighted in torture and murder for its own sake. And there were even darker rumors: Some said he fed upon the blood and souls of those he killed to extend his unnatural life. Some thought him a Daedra, loosed upon the mortal world. And others said he owed his life and power, his armor and swords, to a pact with Dagon, prince of destruction. And the seal of that pact was the terrible wound that scarred his face, never to heal - the Deathbrand, which no man could look upon without flinching.\r\n\r\nAll these things ran through Garuk's mind as he took his place on deck at the head of the crew, exchanging a curt nod with Thalin, the ship's helmsman and his chief rival. By sundown, he thought, one of them would be captain. The other would be dead.\r\n\r\nWhen Haknir finally emerged from his cabin, the crew fell silent. He looked frail, his voice raspy. But even so, he had a presence about him. As he looked over his men, the most brutal murderers ever to ply the northern seas, not one could meet his gaze. At last he sighed.\r\n\r\n\"You wish to know who will be my successor, and how my share of the treasure shall be divided.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the question, but even so, there were murmurs of protest. Haknir cut them off.\r\n\r\n\"All these years, I have looked for one who was worthy to take my place, or strong enough to take it from me. Not one of you even comes close. And so none of you shall have it.\"\r\n\r\nHe extended his hand. \"In Dagon's name, I place a curse upon my armor, and my swords. This ship, and all it carries. Until the day when one of you can best me in combat, you shall have not a single coin.\" He looked up at them. \"Be grateful I have left you with your lives.\"\r\n\r\nGaruk and Thalin shared a single glance. Had anyone else said such a thing, there would have been mutiny. A hundred treasure-mad pirates against one old man. But this was Haknir. The crew was silent.\r\n\r\nHaknir threw a map at Garuk's feet. \"Garuk, take a longboat, and bury my armor in the places I have marked. Thalin, we sail to my tomb, where you shall leave me with my gold. Then burn your ships, and do as you will. I am your captain no more.\" And with that, he turned and stalked back to his quarters.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak, Garuk took his leave, and set out in a longboat with three of his men. They landed on a shoal to the north of Solstheim, at the place Haknir had marked, made camp, and began to dig.\r\n\r\nBut already, greed stirred in Garuk's heart. Time and again, he glanced at the iron-bound chest they had brought with them. The old man was gone, perhaps already dead. His orders, foolish.\r\n\r\nThat night, Garuk pried open the chest and drew out the helm within. The Stalhrim shimmered in the moonlight. It was time. Time for a new King of Ghosts to rise. He placed the helmet on his head.\r\n\r\nAnd he screamed.\r\n\r\nAnd it is said you can hear that screaming still, on moonlit nights, on a rocky shoal off the northern coast of Solstheim.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nPostscript-\r\nThis story is one of the last in the \"Haknir Saga,\" the tales surrounding the life and adventures of the legendary pirate king Haknir Death-Brand.

So much has happened to this tiny town in such a short amount of time, and so many lives have been affected by it, I felt it necessary to describe its rich history within these volumes. During my research, I lived in Raven Rock for almost three years, and I got to know many of my fellow Dunmer who call Raven Rock their home. I hope that my readers will appreciate the amount of fortitude and perseverance that it must take to endure life in such an inhospitable and untamed land.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/A_letter.png'>ll was going well in Raven Rock until 4E 95, when an attempt on Lleril's life was made without warning. Fortunately, the attack was unsuccessful thanks to the prowess of the Redoran Guard. Under questioning by Captain Modyn Veleth, the assassin was revealed to be Vilur Ulen of House Hlaalu. House Hlaalu had been at odds with House Redoran for years following their removal from the Council of Great Houses. The Hlaalu believe that House Redoran was instrumental in this reorganization, and have held a grudge ever since. Their attempt on Lleril's life was meant to send a message to the Council that House Redoran was not as mighty as they purported to be and that they were truly vulnerable and weak. The Redoran Guard investigated futhur and discovered that Vilur had been organizing a coup in Raven Rock in an attempt to fully wrest control of the island from Lleril's grasp. Vilur and his conspirators were executed and the coup was quelled.\r\n\r\nSeveral recent events have served to solidify the Dunmer people's respect for Lleril Morvayn. In 4E 130, the Bulwark began to show its age and threatened to crumble.  The councilor elected to use the bulk of his personal fortune to have it repaired. In 4E 150, a small force of Argonians landed on Solstheim with the intent of wreaking havoc on the island, and Councillor Morvayn led the charge against them personally. And in 4E 170, when the ebony mine finally began to dry up, he drained the remainder of his coffers keeping the people fed.\r\n\r\nBy 4E 181, the mine's ebony veins were completely exhausted. Lleril ordered the mine to be shut down, and Raven Rock turned to hunting and fishing for its trade. A few Dunmer families departed Solstheim and returned to the mainland, but most stayed behind.\r\n\r\nAt present, Lleril Morvayn is still the ruler of Raven Rock. The Redoran Guard continues to maintain order within the town and the surrounding area, keeping Raven Rock's residents safe, and in line.

I sought first-hand accounts and personal views about the cataclysmic event. I felt that if I simply did the research in the library stacks at the College of Winterhold, I wasn't really telling the tale that needed to be told. What struck me as I moved from city to city, town to town, camp to camp is that all of the Dunmer I met shared an incredible bond of sheer courage and unshakable faith. So what began as a chronicle of one of the worst events in the history of Morrowind became something altogether different, the celebration of a people who can never be defeated.\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\nSaldus Llervu\r\nVivec City\r\n\r\n\"I was a trader back then. Ran a pack guar from Vivec City clear down to Narsis. I was walking along the south road when the strangest thing happened. All of the noise around me stopped... the normal things one hears as they travel like the sound of the wind blowing through the treetops. It was just deathly quiet. I felt a tingling sensation all over my body and my guar began to stomp around. Whatever it was, it was driving him crazy. As I tried to get him under control, there was a massive explosion from the center of the city. I saw the cantons fall apart before I was knocked off my feet. Then I remember the ground starting to rumble. It lasted for a long time and it receded into the distance as if directed towards the center of Vvardenfell. A few minutes later, the Red Mountain erupted, sending a huge cloud of fire into the sky. My pack guar had long since fled, and I decided I should do the same. I never stopped running until I reached Narsis.\" \r\n\r\nI asked him if he knew what had happened Vivec City.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't hear until much later that the Ministry of Truth had struck the heart of the city. What I do know for certain is that many Dunmer lost their lives that day and that Vivec City is no more.\"\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nDeros Dran\r\nMournhold\r\n\r\n\"The Red Year didn't heavily affect Mournhold itself, but it touched many of the people who lived there. A lot of us had relatives somewhere on Vvardenfell, and after the first day that the eruption occurred we started receiving reports of widespread devastation in Vivec City, Sadrith Mora, Balmora and Ald'ruhn. I don't think a single night went by for months where you wouldn't hear someone openly weeping. It was a sad time for all of us.\"\r\n\r\nI asked if Mournhold had sustained any damage during the Red Year.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why, but the destruction seemed to pass us by. A few Dunmer claimed that it was the Tribunal watching over us, but others claimed that the Tribunal was to blame for everything. I actually saw a few of those disagreements come to blows. It was a strange time.\"\r\n\r\nI got an interesting response from Deros regarding Mournhold's role during the Red Year.\r\n\r\n\"Relief efforts began almost a month after the mountain erupted. It was actually a directive that came from the House Redoran councilor that was living in Mournhold at the time. I can't remember his name, but he took charge of the situation and sent soldiers, supplies and able-bodied Dunmer to the outlying settlements that had been hit the hardest. I was sent to Balmora. The place was a mess; hardly anything left in town was still standing. I spent maybe two months there, helping to rebuild the town and getting my fellow Dunmer back on their feet. It started out as a burden, but it ended up being the most rewarding thing I'd ever done in my life. I started some friendships there that still last to this day, including my beloved wife.\"","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n紅色年代\r\n第二卷\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n梅里斯．拉維爾 \r\n著\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n前言\r\n\r\n當我決定寫下關於紅色年代的記事時，我前往晨風省四處遊歷，親自尋訪當地的丹莫民眾。我追求的是第一手的紀錄和關於這起大災難的個人觀點——這是因為我認為若只是坐在冬堡學院的書堆中，是無法傳達那些真正應該被傳承下去的故事的。當我來往於大城、小鎮和村莊之間時最讓我震撼的，便是我所遇見的每一個丹莫所共同擁有的大無畏勇氣和堅強意志。於是，這讓原本該是記錄晨風省史上最嚴重災難之一的行程，有了完全不一樣的意義——本書可說是本地的居民歡慶之書，見證他們永遠不會被擊敗的精神。\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n薩朵斯．賴爾弗\r\n維瓦克城\r\n\r\n「從前我是個商人，趕著軋獸來往於維瓦克城和納西斯之間。當時，我正沿著往南的大道趕路，突然我此生僅見最奇特的事情就發生了。所有環繞著我的雜音忽然全面靜止……就是那些一般旅人最常聽見的，好比風吹過樹梢的聲音突然都沒了，只剩下一片死寂。我感到背脊發麻，而我的軋獸則開始四處亂竄，這莫名的現象顯然讓牠躁動不安。我試圖控制牠，市中心突然發生了大規模的爆炸。在我被震飛之前，我看見街區四分五裂，然後地面開始搖晃。震動的情況持續了很長一段的時間，最後終於逐漸減弱，彷彿波動正朝著瓦登費爾的中心遠去。幾分鐘後，紅山就爆發了，將一大團的火焰噴到空中。我的軋獸早就逃了，而我也決定該設法逃命。我一路逃到了納西斯才停下來。」\r\n\r\n我問他知不知道維瓦克城發生了什麼事。\r\n\r\n「除了一段時間以後飄在空中的真理部掉下來撞上城區的中心，我沒聽說發生了什麼事。我只確知許多丹莫在那天喪命，而宏偉的維瓦克城從那一天起便榮光不再了。」\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n德洛斯．德藍\r\n哀傷之城\r\n\r\n「紅色年代並未對哀傷之城本身造成很大的影響，不過確實改變了許多城中的居民。我們之中大多數人都有親戚分散在瓦登費爾省各地，而在爆發當天過後，我們開始收到維瓦克城、薩迪斯摩拉、巴爾摩拉和奧德魯恩遭到嚴重破壞的消息。整整好幾個月，每個晚上都會聽見有人在哭泣的聲音。那對我們所有人來說都是悲傷的時刻。」\r\n\r\n我問他哀傷之城在紅色年代是否有受到任何損傷。\r\n\r\n「我不知道原因，但我們似乎自倖免於難。有些丹莫主張是裁決者在庇佑著我們，但其他人則說他們才是一切災害的罪魁禍首。我曾親眼看見這樣的爭論發展成肢體衝突。那是段很奇怪的時期。」\r\n\r\n關於哀傷之城在紅色年代扮演的角色，我從德洛斯口中聽到了一個有趣的答案。\r\n\r\n「救難行動大約在紅山爆發後一個月左右展開。事實上，那是由一位當時住在哀傷之城中的瑞多然家族議員指揮進行的。我不記得他的名字，但他不僅發號施令，也負責分發補給品，並派遣士兵和有能力幹活的丹莫到那些受創最嚴重的聚落去。我被派往巴爾摩拉，那地方簡直全毀，鎮上幾乎沒有還直立著的建築物。我在那兒待了大概兩個月，協助重建城鎮並扶持當地丹莫，讓他們的生活重回軌道。起初，這對我來說是種負擔，但最後卻成了我此生做過最有價值的事。我在那裡交到了一些朋友，直到現在都還保持聯絡，包括我最愛的妻子在內。」\r\n","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book2CommonRedYear02","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02016E2C|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face=\"$HandwrittenFont\">\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\nEpistolary Acumen\r\n\r\nby the Transparent One\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/B_letter.png'>ring you forth the lovestruck mute who preys with vigor on his love, and set the sky alight with all who dare to struggle 'gainst our move.

But to those who bother to investigate, to dwell, to live, to linger in these spaces, a driving hardiness develops that serves them well in all environs should they ever choose to live. A thoughtfulness born of care -- for who knows best how to best invest their resources than one who has had to walk half a morning and labor for an hour to extract a few drops of water from an unyielding plant? \r\n\r\nThis same sort of requisite thrift applies to all other creatures who wring their living in such a land. The insight that may at first be missed, though, is that the magic of this land is similarly affected. Forgoing the showy lights and sounds of the forest dwelling mages in Summerset, the flamboyant gesticulations of the Bretons, or even the bellowing of the Nords, there is a certain economy to the casting of a true Alik'r wizard. This is not meant as a slight against other magical styles, only noting that a such energies might be better focused into reflection and purpose. \r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nOn Sand\r\n\r\nWhen both foreigners and natives imagine the desert, often their first image is one of orange-hued sand blowing beneath a dark blue sky. Indeed, this is not wholly incorrect, as the shifting sands are one of the key components not only of the desert, but of its natural magics. \r\n\r\nConsider: sand is nothing but the weathering of rocks, older by far than any of the living inhabitants who claim a land as \"theirs.\" As each rock breaks further, more of its inner space is revealed, until it is practically naught but exposed surface in its aggregate self. This collective then scatters, intermingles, scatters, and repeats, in infinite combinations so long as Nirn continues to exist. If we believe, as I do, that the rocks themselves contain remnants of Magnus's gift, than this exposure and combinatorial explosion results in a breadth and diversity of magic energy as is unknown elsewhere in Tamriel. \r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\nOn Air\r\n\r\nMuch as the sand learns from every grain around it, so too does the air which conveys it from one combination to the other absorb the sense knowledge of its carried grains. In fact, it is plausible that the air itself is guiding the combinations to novelty and expression. Indeed, consider that in the Nordic tradition, Kyne is the widow of Shor (an aspect of Lorkhan), then her ministrations (via wind) to his physical legacy within Mundus could be seen as a form of celestial mourning, from which we mortals can benefit. \r\n\r\nIt would seem, indeed, that the next level of magical awakening may well be driven by scrying appropriate wind channels to carve novel paths through the vast desert such as to further diversify the land's memory. Reading the knowledge of the sands, though, is an immense task in itself, though, more fit to an army of clerical workers than a wizard of any standing. \r\n","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n風與沙\r\n\r\n阿法-沙爾亞 \r\n著\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<font face='$HandwrittenFont'>\r\n讓風吹刮，讓沙沖刷，讓風和沙的魔法在阿利克爾自由流浪。從兩者間的神秘薄膜，吸收並移轉到我及所有了解沙漠力量深刻本質的人身上。</font>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/D_letter.png'>沙漠常被認為是無用的荒地，悠閒的旅人想要規避它，就連軟弱的種族也拒絕在此地發展文明。但是，對那些努力探查、生活、定居並留戀於這些空間的人而言，如果居住在此真是他們的選擇，這種驅迫性的艱困過程反倒讓他們對周遭事物感到適得其所。這是一種因需要而生的深思熟慮。畢竟誰最懂得把自己的資源做最好的投資呢？當然是那些需要走上大半個上午，再工作一個小時才能從一株頑固植物萃取幾滴水的人啊。\r\n\r\n對必需品的節約，適用於在此刻苦求生的所有生物。起初或許會被忽視的洞見是：這塊土地的魔法也同樣受到影響。請忘了夏暮森林魔法師的炫麗光線和聲響，也請忘了布萊頓人誇張的手勢，甚或諾德人的轟然怒吼，真正的阿利克爾魔法師所點化的一切都更為簡約。相對於其他的魔法風格，這樣絕非更輕易，只是注意到能量最好集中於映象與意向。\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n沙\r\n\r\n\r\n無論外地或本地人，想到沙漠時的第一印象通常都是黃褐色沙粒在深藍色天空下翻騰。確實，這印象並非全然錯誤，因為永遠動個不停的沙不僅是沙漠的重要構成元素之一，也是沙漠原汁原味的神奇魅力。\r\n\r\n試想：沙粒只是岩石風化的產物，卻遠比任何宣稱土地「屬於他們」的居民更有歷史。隨著每一塊岩石繼續破裂，就有更多內部空間出現，直到岩石完全消失，只剩它的集合體暴露於表面。先聚集然後潰散，混和又分散，一再重複，只要奈恩長在，這循環就不斷地繼續演繹。如果我們相信，一如我就打從心底深信，那些岩石擁有瑪格努斯禮物的餘跡，那麼這樣的展現和那些分裂的結果，必然使此地的魔法能量就分布的廣度和多樣性來說，比泰姆瑞爾的任何地方都更為豐富。\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n大氣\r\n\r\n\r\n一如沙從周遭的每一顆沙粒學習，從一個組合傳達到另一個組合的大氣也一樣，它從它所攜帶的微粒吸收意識的知識。事實上，大氣的本身引領那些組合前往新奇的地方，並給了它表情。這是真的，試想：在諾德人的傳統，凱娜是朔爾的寡婦（從洛克汗的觀點），那麼她對他遍布於夢達思的實體傳承的服侍（經由風），其實可被當成來自天國的哀悼，而我們凡人則從中受惠。\r\n\r\n倘若我們以適當的靈視把風在廣大沙漠上所刻畫的新路徑當成它留在這塊土地的記憶，似乎可以激發另一層次的魔法覺醒。閱讀沙的知識，確實是一項浩瀚的任務，似乎更適合一群神職工作者，而非法師。\r\n","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2TTR3bWindAndSand","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201DA11|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<p align='center'><font face='$HandwrittenFont'><font size='25'>\r\n\r\n\r\nRuby Gem\r\n\r\nSalt Pile\r\n\r\nAlbino Spider Pod\r\n\r\n</font></p>\r\n","string":"<p align='center'><font face='$HandwrittenFont'><font size='25'>\r\n\r\n\r\n紅寶石\r\n\r\n鹽堆\r\n\r\n白化蜘蛛卵囊\r\n\r\n</font></p>","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2ExpSpiderCrftBookFireCloak","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02026D5A|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Recipe - Jumping Shock Spider 2x","string":"配方 - 閃電跳蛛 2x","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2ExpSpiderCrftBookShockJumping2x","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02026D57|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Recipe - Shock Cloaked Spider","string":"配方 - 電罩蜘蛛","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2ExpSpiderCrftBookShockCloak","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201DA12|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Recipe - Flame Cloaked Spider 2x","string":"配方 - 焰罩蜘蛛 2x","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2ExpSpiderCrftBookFireCloak2x","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02028274|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Poison Song\r\nBook VII\r\n\r\nBy\r\nBristin Xel\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>riffith stood on the parapets of Barysimayn and considered the volcano. Metaphors the poets used fell rather flat in his view. A festering wound it could be called with its blood-like lava. The King of Ash, too, could be applied, when one looked at its perpetual crown of smoke. And yet, none of that would do, for nothing in his experience could convey the sheer magnitude of the mountain. Red Mountain was many miles away from the fortress, and yet it filled the horizon utterly.\r\n \r\n\r\nBefore he could feel too small, however, he heard his name being called within. It was some consolation that though he was insignificant compared to the mountain, he was still in possession of certain power and influence.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"General Indoril-Triffith,\" said Commander Rael. \"There's trouble at the east gate.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nThe trouble was scarcely more than a skirmish. An Ashlander, drunk perhaps on shein, had begun a fight with the House guards at the back gate. As they tried to drive him away, his cousins joined him, and soon there were six Ashlanders altogether brawling with a dozen of Triffith's guards. If the n'wahs had not been well-armed, the fight could have been finished almost before it began. As it was, by the time the General arrived with more of his guards, two of the Ashlanders were dead and the others had taken flight.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"It's the smoke in their brains,\" Rael shrugged. \"Makes them mad.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nTriffith climbed back up the stairs and returned to his chamber to dress for dinner. General Redoran-Vorilk and Counselor Hlaalu-Nothoc would be arriving very shortly to discuss the Temple's plans for reorganizing the House lands of Morrowind. Mournhold was to be renamed Almalexia. A great new city in honor of Vivec was to be built, but with whose gold? It made his head hurt. There were so many details, a long night of argument, threats, and compromises were ahead.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe General's mind was so occupied that he nearly put his House robes on backwards. He also did not notice the shadowy figure steal out from behind the tapestry and close the door to the bedchamber. It was not until Triffith heard the sound of the latch-bolt fall that he turned around.\r\n \r\n\r\n'Slipped in when I was distracted by the fracas at the back gate. Very clever, Tay,\" he said simply. \"Or do you call yourself Dagoth-Tython these days?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"You should know all my names,\" the young man snarled, unsheathing his sword. \"I was Tython before you butchered my family and sought to dispel my tribe. I was Tay when you brought me into your House to poison me against my own people. Now you may call me Vengeance.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nThere was a knock on the door. Tython and Triffith did not move their eyes from one another. The knocking became a loud pounding. \"General Indoril-Triffith, are you well? Is there something wrong?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"If you're going to kill me, boy, you'd best do it quickly,\" Triffith growled. \"My men will have that door down in two minutes.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"You don't tell me what to do, 'Uncle,'\" Tython shook his head. \"I have the Song of my ancestors to instruct me. It tells me you made my father beg for his life before you killed him, and I want to see you do the same.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"If your ancestors are all-knowing,\" Triffith smiled. \"Why are they all dead?\" \r\n\r\n\r\nTython made an inhuman noise in the back of his throat and advanced. The door began to buckle at the pounding, but it was sturdy and secure. The general's estimate of its life expectancy at two minutes seemed clearly erroneous.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe pounding suddenly stopped. A familiar voice replaced the sound. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Tay,\" called Baynarah. \"Listen to me.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nTython smirked, \"You're just in time to hear your uncle beg for his miserable life, 'cousin.' I was afraid you'd be too late. The next sound you'll hear will be the death rattle of the man who slaved my House.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"The Song is what's enslaved you, not Uncle Triffith. You can't trust it. It's poisoning you. It let you be manipulated first by that mad old woman, and now by that evil witch Acra who calls herself your sister.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nTython pressed the tip of his sword so it touched the general's throat. The older man stepped backwards and Tython advanced. His eyes followed the length of his arm to the grip of the blade. The silver ring of Dagoth caught the red light of the volcano from the battlements outside the window.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Tay, please don't hurt anyone anymore. Please. If you just listen to me, and not the Song just a moment, you'll know what's right. I love you.\" Baynarah stifled her sobs to keep her voice clear and calm. There was a noise on the stairwell behind her. The general's guard had finally arrived with the battering ram.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe door splintered and burst open in two strikes. General Indoril-Triffith was holding his throat, staring out the window.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Uncle! Are you all right?\" Baynara ran to him. He nodded his head slowly, and removed his hand. There was only the barest of scratches on his neck. \"Where's Tay?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"He jumped out the window,\" said Triffith, pointing out into the distance where a figure was riding a guar toward the volcano. \"I thought he was going to kill himself, but he had an escape figured out.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"We'll get him, serjo general,\" said Commander Rael, calling to the guards to get their mounts. Baynarah watched them go, and then kissed her uncle quickly and ran out to her own guar in the courtyard.\r\n \r\n\r\nSweat drenched Tay's body as he rode closer and closer toward the summit of Red Mountain. The guar was breathing hard, trudging along even more slowly, letting out little grunts of complaint about the heat. Finally, he abandoned his steed and began to climb the near vertical surface. Ash blew down the face of the volcano into his eyes. Near-blind, it was almost impossible to ignore the persistent, clamorous notes of the Song.\r\n \r\n\r\nA silken stream of crimson lava studded with crystalline formations surged a few feet away, close enough that Tay could feel his flesh begin to burn and blister. He turned from it, and saw a figure emerge through the smoke. Baynarah.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"What are you doing, Tay?\" she cried over the howl of the volcano. \"Didn't I tell you not to listen to the Song?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"For the first time, the Song and I both want the same thing!\" he yelled back. \"I can't ask you to forgive me, but please try to forget!\"\r\n \r\n\r\nHe pulled himself higher, out of Baynarah's sight. She screamed his name, scaling the rocks until she found she was close to the open crater. Waves of boiling gas washed over her, and she dropped to her knees, gasping. Through the rippling miasma, she saw Tay standing at the mouth of the volcano. Flames erupted from his clothes and hair. He turned to her just for a moment and smiled.\r\n \r\n\r\nThen he leapt. \r\n\r\n\r\nBaynarah was in a daze as she began the long, treacherous climb down the volcano. She began to think of the projects ahead. Were there enough provisions in storage at her house in Gorne for the meeting of the Houses? The councilors were bound to stay there for weeks, maybe months. There was much work to be done. Slowly, as she descended, she began to forget. It would not last, but it would be a start.\r\n \r\n\r\nDagoth-Acra stood as near to the mouth of the volcano as she could stand, blinking her eyes at the ash, soaked by the heat. She watched all, and smiled. On the ground was the silver ring with the seal of the House Dagoth. Tython had been sweating so much, it had slipped off. She picked it up and put it on her own finger. Touching her belly, she heard a new refrain of the Poison Song of Morrowind begin.\r\n ","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n毒藥之頌\r\n第七冊\r\n\r\n畢斯汀．謝爾 \r\n著\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>崔斐斯站在拜里西麥恩的擋牆上，審視著火山。跟他眼前景象相較，詩人筆下的隱喻黯然失色。血液般的岩漿，讓火山看來彷彿留著膿的傷口。也有人將之比喻為灰燼之王，那終年不歇的濃煙正是王冠。可是這些都不夠到位，沒有任何事物能精確呈現出這座山的純粹壯麗。紅山距堡壘有幾哩之遙，但卻徹底佔據了整個地平線。\r\n\r\n\r\n他還沒來得及感受到自己的渺小，就先聽到有人叫喚他的名字。這倒是某種安慰，儘管相較於紅山，他不足為道，然而他還是掌握了一定的權勢和影響力。 \r\n\r\n\r\n「因督利爾．崔斐斯將軍，」拉爾指揮官開口。「東門出了亂子。」\r\n\r\n\r\n那個麻煩充其量不過是場小衝突。一個灰燼人大概仙飲喝多了，在後城門跟家族守衛打了起來。大家試著把兩人拉開時，灰燼人的血親也加入混戰，情勢迅速變成六個灰燼人對抗六名家族守衛。要不是那些賤民持有武器，這場紛爭大概還沒開始就結束了。等將軍帶著更多人手抵達時，兩個灰燼人死了，其餘的早已溜之大吉。\r\n\r\n\r\n「都是他們腦袋裡的煙，」拉爾聳聳肩。「讓他們瘋了。」\r\n\r\n\r\n崔斐斯爬上樓梯，返回房間為晚餐治裝。瑞多然．佛力克將軍和拉魯．挪梭可議員很快就會抵達，和他一同研討神殿對晨風省家族領地重劃的計劃。哀傷之城將改名為愛瑪蕾希雅，另外還要新建一座榮耀維瓦克的新城市，不過新城市該使用哪個家族的金幣？崔斐斯的頭都痛了。有許多細節必須考慮，今晚將異常漫長，充斥著爭論、威嚇和妥協。\r\n\r\n\r\n將軍滿腦子煩心事，差點把家族長袍給穿反了。他也沒注意到那個從掛毯後面溜出來把通往臥房的門關上的身影。直到聽聞門閂落鎖的聲音，崔斐斯才轉過身。\r\n\r\n\r\n「趁我調解後城門騷亂的空檔溜進來。很聰明啊，泰伊，」他簡潔說道。「或者該叫你達格斯．泰伊松呢？」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「你應該對我的名字瞭若指掌，」年輕人吼叫著抽劍出鞘。「在你殘殺我家人，試圖毀我家族之前，我是泰伊松。然後你帶我回你家，灌輸我跟自己族人對抗的毒藥，我成了泰伊。現在，復仇就是我的名字。」\r\n\r\n\r\n敲門聲響起，泰伊松和崔斐斯依然四目相對。輕敲成了重捶。「因督利爾．崔斐斯將軍，你還好吧？有什麼不對嗎？」\r\n\r\n\r\n「孩子，如果你要殺我，最好趕快下手，」崔斐斯咆哮。「再兩分鐘，我的人就會拆了那扇門。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「你沒資格命令我，『叔叔』，」泰伊松搖著頭。「我的先祖之頌會指引我。它告訴我你殺死我父親之前，讓他哀求你饒他一命，我也要你苦苦求饒。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「如果你的祖先全知全能，」崔斐斯微笑。「為什麼他們全死了呢？」\r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊松從喉嚨深處發出非人類的怒吼，猛往前衝。門開始因為猛烈的捶擊而略微鬆動，但它依然相當堅實而牢靠。將軍斷言它只剩兩分鐘性命顯然錯得離譜。\r\n\r\n\r\n捶門聲愕然中止，取而代之的是一個熟悉的嗓音。\r\n\r\n\r\n「泰伊，」蓓娜拉喚道。「聽我說。」\r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊嘻嘻笑道：「妳剛好趕上妳叔叔求我饒他一命的好戲，『堂姐』，我還怕妳遲到呢。妳聽到的下一個聲音，將會是奴役我家族之人的垂死掙扎。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「奴役你的是那首歌，不是崔斐斯叔叔。你不能盡信它，它正在毒害你。因為它，你先被那個老女人玩弄於股掌間，現在則落入那個自稱是妳妹妹的邪惡巫婆雅可拉手中，隨她揉捏。」\r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊多施了些壓力，如今劍尖已經抵住將軍的喉嚨。年長男人後退，而泰伊進逼。崔斐斯的眼神隨劍身移動至緊握的手，達格斯的銀戒染上窗外城牆遠方的火山紅光。\r\n\r\n\r\n「泰伊，請你別再傷害任何人了。拜託。一下下就好，請你聽我而不是那首歌的話，你就會知道孰是孰非。我愛你。」蓓娜拉忍住嗚咽，讓聲音平穩又清晰。她身後的樓梯井傳來聲響，將軍的衛兵終於帶著破城槌抵達。\r\n\r\n\r\n房門裂成兩半。因督利爾．崔斐斯將軍手遮喉嚨，看著窗外。 \r\n\r\n\r\n「叔叔！你還好嗎？」蓓娜拉跑過去。他緩緩點頭，移開他的手。他的脖子上僅有極輕微的刮傷。「泰伊呢？」\r\n\r\n\r\n「他跳出窗戶跑了，」 崔斐斯說，指著遠方一個騎著軋獸往火山而去的身影。「我以為他要自殺，結果他居然逃了。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「我們會抓到他，將軍大人，」拉爾指揮官說道，下令要衛兵登上座騎。蓓娜拉目送他們離去，很快啄吻了叔叔，然後跑向中庭騎上她的軋獸。 \r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊越來越靠近紅山的山峰，大汗淋漓。軋獸呼吸沉重，跋涉的腳步變得緩慢，不時發出抱怨高溫的小小哼聲。終於，他捨棄了座騎，開始往上攀爬。灰燼刮過火山表面，吹進他的雙眼。在視力幾乎全失的狀況下，要忽視那首歌持續不斷的高昂樂音簡直不可能。\r\n\r\n\r\n散布著結晶體的柔滑深紅岩漿從幾呎外湧出，近得泰伊可以感覺到他的血肉開始燒灼起水泡。他轉個方向，看到煙霧中浮現一個身影。是蓓娜拉。\r\n\r\n\r\n「你在做什麼，泰伊？」她扯開喉嚨，壓過火山的怒吼。「我不是叫你別聽那首歌嗎？」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「這是第一次，那首歌和我的目標一致！」他喊回去。「我無法要妳原諒我，那麼就忘了我吧！」 \r\n\r\n\r\n他爬得更高，超出了蓓娜拉的視線。她叫著他的名字，攀爬著岩石，直到她發現自己位在開闊的火山口附近。一陣又一陣的滾燙氣體沖刷過她的身軀，她不禁跪下喘息。一波波的沼氣之中，她看到泰伊站在火山口，火舌從他的衣服和頭髮奔竄而出。他轉向她，露出笑容。\r\n\r\n\r\n然後回頭一躍而下。\r\n\r\n\r\n蓓娜拉爬下火山，在這段漫長又危險的路途中，她陷入恍惚狀態。她開始想起眼前該做的事。她在葛尼島上的家中，有足夠的食物庫存供給家族會議的與會來賓嗎？那些議員有可能會被迫待在島上幾星期，甚至幾個月。有好多事情要準備。在下山的路上，慢慢的，她開始遺忘。她不可能永遠忘記，但起碼是個開始。\r\n\r\n\r\n達格斯．雅可拉盡可能地靠近火山口，站在那兒眨著眼睛抵抗灰燼，沐浴在熱氣之中。她四下張望，然後露出微笑。有著達格斯家族封印的銀色戒指躺在地上。泰伊松留了太多汗讓戒指滑落了。她撿起戒指戴上。她撫著肚子，她聽到晨風毒頌再次響起新的樂音。","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book1CheapPoisonSong7","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0203780A|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Torn Note","string":"撕破的字條","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2dunGyldenhulNote","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02028262|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\nBone, Part II \r\n\r\nBy \r\nTavi Dromio \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean the story gets more appalling?\" Garaz was incredulous. \"How in Boethiah's name could it get more appalling?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"It's a ruse,\" Xiomara scoffed, ordering two more mugs of greef and a glass of flin for Garaz. \"How much worse can a tale get which prominently features cannibalism, abuse of slaves, and the regular placement of rotting animal carcasses?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Don't you dare dare me,\" growled Hallgerd, annoyed by his listeners' lack of appreciation of his prose styling. \"Remind me where we were?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Arslic Oan is the owner of a stronghold under siege by savage, cannibalistic Nords,\" said Xiomara, keeping a straight face. \"After a lot of deaths and several unsuccessful attempts to get water, he had his armorer with the unlikely name of Gorkith outfit his slaves with the first ever bonemold armor. One of them finally makes it back with some water.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nIt was only one jarful of water (said Hallgerd, pulling back in his chair and continuing the tale), and Arslic Oan drank most of it, passing the remains to his dear armorer Gorkith and the last dribbles to the few dozen slaves who still lived. It was hardly enough to sustain health and well-being. Another expedition was necessary, but they had only one suit of bonemold left, as there was only one survivor of the trip.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"One out of eighteen slaves made it through the gauntlet of Nords wearing that marvelous bonemold armor of yours,\" said Arslic Oan to Gorkith. \"And one can only carry back enough water for one. Therefore, mathematically, as we have, counting you and me, fifty-six remaining people at the stronghold, we need armor for fifty-four. Since we already have one, you only need to make fifty-three to make the total. That way, three will make it back, with enough water for you and me and whoever's in the best condition to partake. I don't know what we'll do after that, but if we wait, we won't have enough slaves to fetch even a couple days' worth of water.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" whimpered Gorkith. \"But how am I going to make the armor? I used all the livestock bones to make the first batch of bonemold.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nArslic Oan gave an order which Gorkith fearfully complied with. In eighteen hours -\r\n \r\n\r\n\"What do you mean 'Arslic Oan gave an order which Gorkith fearfully complied with'?\" asked Xiomara. \"What was the order?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"All will be clear,\" smiled Hallgerd. \"I have to chose what to reveal and what to conceal. Such is the way of the tale teller.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nIn eighteen hours, Gorkith had fifty-three suits of bonemail (said Hallgerd, continuing, not really minding the interruption) prepared for the slaves. Without prompting, he ordered the slaves to practice using the armor, and even allowed them more training time than their predecessors. They not only learned how to move and stop quickly in bonemold, but how to adjust their peripheral vision to see a blow before it came, and to sway to dodge, and where the sturdiest reinforcement points on the arm were -- the center of the chest and the abdomen -- and how to position themselves to take blows there, against their natural instincts. The slaves even had time for a mock battle before being sent out among the cannibals.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe slaves handled themselves admirably. Very few, just fifteen slaves, were killed and eaten out right. Only ten were killed and eaten when they reached the river. That was when things did not go according to Arslic Oan's plans. Twenty-one slaves with jars of water took off for the hills. Only eight returned to the castle, largely because they were blocked by the cannibal Nords. It was a larger percentage than he had anticipated surviving, but Arslic Oan felt righteous indignation at the paucity of loyalty.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Are you absolutely certain you wouldn't rather flee?\" he hollered from the battlements.\r\n \r\n\r\nFinally, he allowed the survivors in. Three had been killed waiting for the gate to open. Two more died almost upon stepping into the courtyard. One was delirious, walking around in circles, laughing and dancing before suddenly collapsing. That meant five jars of water for four people, the two surviving slaves, Arslic Oan, and Gorkith. As the lord of the manor, Arslic Oan took the extra jar, but he was democratic with the others.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"You're quite correct,\" frowned Garaz. \"This story is getting more and more appalling.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Just wait,\" smiled Hallgerd. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning (Hallgerd continued) Arslic Oan awoke to a perfectly still and quiet stronghold. There was no murmuring in the corridors, no sound of hard labor in the courtyard. He dressed and surveyed the scene. It appeared that the fortress was utterly deserted. Arslic Oan walked down to the armorer's quarters, but the door was locked.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Open up,\" said Arslic Oan, patiently. \"We need to speak. Thirty out of fifty-four slaves successfully made it to the river and gathered water. Admittedly, some then fled, and a couple didn't survive because I needed to correct their fickleness, but mathematically, that's a fifty-five percent survival rate. If you and I and the two remaining slaves made the next run to the river, we two should survive.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Zilian and Gelo left last night with their armor,\" cried Gorklith through the door.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Who are Zilian and Gelo?\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"The two remaining slaves! They don't remain anymore!\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's vexing,\" said Arslic Oan. \"Still we must continue on. Mathematically--\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I heard something last night,\" whimpered Gorklith in a funny voice. \"Like footsteps, only different, and they were moving through the walls. And there were voices too. They sounded strange, like they couldn't move their jaws very well, but I knew one.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nArslic Oan sighed, humoring his poor armorer: \"And who was it?\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ponik.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"And who is Ponik?\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"One of the slaves that died when the Nords poisoned our water. One of the many, many slaves that died, and we made use of. He was always a nice, uncomplaining fellow, that's why I noticed his voice above all the others,\" Gorklith began to sob. \"I understood what he was saying.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Which was what?\" asked Arslic Oan with a sigh. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"'Give me back my bones!'\" Gorklith's voice shrieked. There was silence for a moment, and then more hysterical sobbing.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I saw that coming,\" laughed Xiomara. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more to be done with the armorer for the time being (said Hallgerd, a trifle annoyed at the regular interruptions), so Arslic Oan stripped one of the dead slaves of his suit of bonemold and put it on. He practiced in the courtyard, impressing himself with his natural comfortably with medium weight armor. For hours, he boxed, feinted, dodged, sprinted, skipped, jumped, and generally cavorted about. When he felt tired, he retired to the shade and took a nap.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe sound of the king's trumpet woke him with a start. Night had fallen, and for a moment, he thought he had been dreaming. Then the alarum sounded again, far in the distance, but clear. Arslic Oan leapt to his feet and ran to the ramparts. Several miles away, he could see the emissaries and their vast and well-armed escort approach. They were there early! The cannibal Nords below looked at one another with consternation. Savages they might be, but they knew when a superior force was approaching.\r\n \r\n\r\nArslic Oan joyously dashed down the stairs to Gorklith's chamber. The door was still locked. He beat on it, cajoling, demanding, threatening. Finally, he found a key, one of the few scraps of metal that had not been smelted days before.\r\n \r\n\r\nGorklith appeared to be sleeping, but as Arslic Oan approached, he noticed that the armorer's mouth and eyes were wide open and his arms were folded unnaturally behind his back. On closer inspection, the armorer was obviously dead. What was more, his face and whole body were sunken, like an empty pig's bladder.\r\n \r\n\r\nSomething moved through the walls, like a footfall only... squishy. Arslic Oan expertly and gracefully turned to face it, completely in balance.\r\n \r\n\r\nAt first, it seemed like nothing more than a bubble expanding through one of the cracks in the stone. As more of the flesh-colored gelatinous matter emerged, it more clearly resembled part of a face. A flaccid, almost shapeless face with a low brow and a slack, toothless jaw. The rest of the body oozed out of the crack, a soft bag of muscle and blood. Behind Arslic Oan and to the side, there was more movement, more slaves welling up through the cracks in the stone. They were all around him, reaching out.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Give us,\" moaned Ponik, his tongue rolling about his hanging jaw. \"Give us back our bones.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nArslic Oan began to rip off his bonemold, throwing it to the floor. A hundred figures, more, pooled into the small chamber.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"That's not enough.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nThe cannibals had cleared away by the time the king's emissaries arrived at Arslic Oan's gates. They had not been looking forward to this visit. It was best, they though philosophically, to begin with the worst of the king's noblemen, so to end their trip well. They sounded the alarum once again, but the gates did not open. There was no sound from Arslic Oan's stronghold.\r\n \r\n\r\nIt took a few hours to gain access. If the emissaries had not brought a professional acrobat with them for entertainment, it might have taken longer. The place seemed to be abandoned. They searched every room, until finally they came to the armorer's.\r\n \r\n\r\nThere they found the master of the manor, folded neatly, legs behind his head, arms behind the legs, like a fine gown. Not a bone in his body.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"The first part of your story was complete nonsense,\" cried Xiomara. \"But now it doesn't hold true on any level. How could bonemold be made again if the armorer who invented it died before he could tell anyone how he did it?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I said that this was the first time it was created, not the first time people learned the craft.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"And when did someone first teach someone else the craft?\" asked Garaz. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"That, my friends,\" replied Hallgerd with a sinister smile. \"Is a tale for another night.\"\r\n \r\n ","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n骨頭，第二部\r\n\r\n塔唯．卓米歐 \r\n著\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n「還有更可怕的？」葛拉茲難以置信。「以波耶西亞之名，這故事怎麼可能更駭人？」\r\n \r\n\r\n「那只是他唬人的花招，」休馬拉語氣嘲弄，再要了兩馬克杯的葛福，也替葛拉茲點了一玻璃杯的飛令。「一個以食人族、虐待奴隸和腐爛動物屍體再利用為主角的故事，能可怕到哪裡去？」\r\n \r\n\r\n「你少惹我，」霍格德咆哮道，對於聽眾竟然不捧他場感到很不高興。「我剛才說到哪裡了？」\r\n\r\n\r\n「厄斯力．翁的堡壘被野蠻的食人族諾德人包圍，」休馬拉面無表情地回答。「因為死了一堆人，但還是取不到水，他要名字很怪、叫做葛奇仕的護甲師做出前所未見的骨模盔甲，讓奴隸穿了去取水，終於有一個成功取水回來。」\r\n\r\n\r\n這唯一的一壺水（霍格德把椅子往後拉，繼續說故事），厄斯力．翁喝了大半，剩下一些給他親愛的護甲師，再留最後幾滴給還活著的幾十個奴隸。這些水當然不足以讓他們保持健康和安適。他們需要另一次遠征，但現在只剩一副骨模，因為只有一個奴隸活著回來。\r\n\r\n\r\n「經過諾德人的密集攻擊，十八個穿著你非凡盔甲的奴隸只有一個生還，」厄斯力．翁對葛奇仕說。「而他帶回來的水只夠一個人喝。以數學計算，包括你我，堡壘內目前還有五十六個人，我們需要五十四副骨模，既然我們已經有一副了，你只需要再做五十三副。然後估計會有三個人回來，把這三壺水給我、你，和最強壯的那個人喝。我不知道接下來會怎樣，但我們如果再等下去，很快就沒有足夠的奴隸出去取水了。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「我明白，」葛奇仕抽噎著說。「但我要怎麼做盔甲？第一批骨模已經把家畜的骨頭都用光了。」\r\n\r\n\r\n厄斯力．翁依然下了一道命令，而葛奇仕也只能戰戰兢兢地服從。在十八個小時內—— \r\n\r\n\r\n「你所謂『厄斯力．翁依然下了一道命令，而葛奇仕也只能戰戰兢兢地服從』是什麼意思？」休馬拉發問。「他下了什麼命令？」\r\n \r\n\r\n「好戲在後頭，」霍格德露出微笑。「我必須選擇要透漏什麼情節，又該暫時隱瞞哪些部分。高明的說書人都是這樣的。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n十八個小時之內，葛奇仕替奴隸做好了五十三套骨模盔甲（霍格德繼續說，毫不介意剛才被打斷）。這次他逕自要奴隸練習使用盔甲，甚至還給他們更多的訓練時間。他們不只練習如何快速移動和停止，也練習調整餘光好及時看見揮擊而來的木棒並閃避，以及哪裡是盔甲最堅固的點——胸部和腹部的中心——他們該怎樣克服本能的閃躲反應，擺好位置用這兩點去抵擋木棒攻擊打擊。這些奴隸甚至有機會分兩隊打了一場模擬戰鬥，才被派去面對食人族。\r\n\r\n\r\n奴隸的表現非常出色。只有十五人立刻被殺和吃掉，到達河邊時也只有十個被殺死吃掉。從這裡開始情勢漸漸違背了厄斯力．翁的計劃。二十一個奴隸從河邊取了水，不過因為被諾德人阻擋，只有八人回到堡壘。倖存率比預期更高，但厄斯力．翁卻對這樣的忠誠感到不悅。\r\n\r\n\r\n「你們真的不想逃走嗎？」他從堡壘上大叫。\r\n \r\n\r\n最後，他終於允許倖存者進來。三人在等待城門開啟時被殺，兩個在快要踏入院子時死去，一個發了瘋，又笑又跳地繞著圈子，而後突然倒地。這表示他們有五壺水，可以給四個人喝：兩個倖存的奴隸、厄斯力．翁和葛奇仕。身為領主，厄斯力．翁拿了多出來的一壺水，但他採取民主的方式，與其他人平分。\r\n\r\n\r\n葛拉茲皺起眉頭。「沒錯，這故事越來越可怕了。」\r\n \r\n\r\n「等著瞧，」霍格德微笑。\r\n\r\n\r\n第二天早上（霍格德繼續），厄斯力．翁在完全寂靜的堡壘中醒來。走廊無人呻吟，院子裡也沒有工作勞動的聲響。他穿好衣服，巡視一圈，整座堡壘看來淨空了。厄斯力．翁下樓來到護甲師的房間，但他的門鎖著。\r\n\r\n\r\n「開門，」厄斯力．翁很有耐心地說。「我們必須討論一下。五十四個奴隸裡有三十人順利去到河邊取水。我得承認有些人逃走了，另外有些因為我必須糾正他們的浮躁而丟了性命，但就數學上來說，存活率是百分之五十五。如果，你和我跟剩下的兩個奴隸去河邊，我們兩個應該可以倖存。」\r\n \r\n\r\n「齊利安和蓋羅昨晚穿著他們的盔甲離開了，」葛奇仕從門後喊道。\r\n\r\n\r\n「齊利安和蓋羅是誰？」\r\n\r\n\r\n「剩下的兩個奴隸！他們不再『剩下』了！」\r\n\r\n\r\n「唉，這可麻煩了，」厄斯力．翁說。「但我們還是要繼續。就數學上來說——」\r\n\r\n\r\n「我昨晚聽到一些聲音，」葛奇仕發出古怪的哀鳴。「像腳步聲，但又不一樣，在牆壁來回穿梭。還有說話聲，聽起來很奇怪，好像他們的下巴不太能動，但是我聽出一個人的聲音。」\r\n\r\n\r\n厄斯力．翁嘆著氣迎合他可憐的護甲師。「哦，那是誰？」\r\n\r\n\r\n「龐尼克。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「龐尼克是誰？」\r\n\r\n\r\n「我們的水被諾德人下毒時死掉的一個奴隸。很多很多死去而且屍首被我們利用的奴隸之一。他生前是個從不抱怨的好人，所以我才特別注意到他的聲音，」葛奇仕開始啜泣。「我聽得懂他的話。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「他說什麼？」厄斯力．翁嘆著氣問。\r\n\r\n\r\n「『把我的骨頭還給我！』」葛奇仕尖叫。安靜片刻後，又傳來歇斯底里的啜泣聲。\r\n\r\n\r\n「我就猜是這樣，」休馬拉大笑。\r\n\r\n\r\n看來護甲師一時也派不上用場（霍格德有點不高興被打擾，但還是繼續），所以厄斯力．翁脫下一名死去奴隸的骨模盔甲，自己穿上。他在院子裡練習，對自己毫無困難便適應這中等重量的盔甲感到自豪不已。他出拳、佯攻、閃躲、衝刺、轉身、跳躍，而且到處跑動，練習了好幾個小時。等他終於覺得累了，便到樹蔭下打個盹。\r\n\r\n\r\n國王的號角聲突然將他吵醒。時間已是晚上，他一時還以為自己在作夢。那個警示音再度出現，雖然很遠但很清楚，厄斯力．翁跳起來跑到堡壘城牆上。他看到國王特使和其武力堅強的護衛隊正從幾哩之外逐漸靠近。他們提早來了！圍在城下的食人族諾德人驚恐地面面相望。他們或許是野蠻人，但他們知道更強的軍隊正在靠近。\r\n \r\n\r\n厄斯力．翁歡欣鼓舞地衝下樓梯，跑去葛奇仕的房間。房門依然鎖著。他敲著門，好言相勸、大聲命令，而後恐嚇威脅。最後他找到一把鑰匙，那是少數逃過火熔命運的小塊金屬之一。\r\n\r\n\r\n葛奇仕似乎在睡覺，但等厄斯力．翁靠近，他注意到護甲師的嘴巴和眼睛都張得好大，手臂不自然地疊在身後。再仔細一看，護甲師顯然已經死了。不僅如此，他的臉和整副身軀已經凹陷，好像被清空了的豬膀胱。\r\n\r\n\r\n有東西從牆壁穿出，聽起來像腳步聲……但是黏黏的。厄斯力．翁處變不驚地轉身面對。\r\n\r\n\r\n起先，那只像是牆縫裡冒出的泡泡。接著肉色的凝膠物逐漸擴大，越來越像人臉的一部份。一張軟綿綿、無形無狀的臉，有對低垂的眉毛和沒牙的鬆弛下巴。接著，身體的其餘部分也從牆縫裡逐漸滲出來，簡直是只有肌肉和血液的軟皮囊。厄斯力．翁身後和旁邊紛紛有所動靜，越來越多奴隸從牆縫裡冒出來。他們包圍住他，伸出手來。\r\n \r\n\r\n「還我們，」龐尼克呻吟，他的舌頭從垂掛的下巴掉出來。「還我們骨頭來。」\r\n\r\n\r\n厄斯力．翁開始脫下骨模，扔在地上。一百個、或許更多的形體，湧進了小房間。\r\n \r\n\r\n「這些不夠。」\r\n\r\n國王特使抵達厄斯力．翁的城門時，食人族已經跑光了。特使團並不喜歡出巡，所以決定從最討厭的諸侯開始，這樣旅程就能愉快收尾。他們大老遠便已發出警告，但是城門竟然沒有開。厄斯力．翁的堡壘一點聲音也無。\r\n\r\n\r\n他們花了好幾小時才得以進門。要不是特使團帶了幾個提供娛樂的特技人員，說不定還得拖更久。堡壘好像唱空城計，他們搜索了每個角落，最後來到護甲師的房間。\r\n\r\n\r\n堡壘的主人好像一件長袍那般，被摺疊得整整齊齊放在那裡，雙腿在頭的後方，雙手在腿的後方。身體裡面一根骨頭也沒有。\r\n\r\n \r\n「你的故事從一開始就全是胡說，」休馬拉嚷道。「現在更是無法成立。如果發明骨模的護甲師在把製作方法告訴別人之前就已經死了，骨模怎麼可能又被製造出來？」\r\n\r\n\r\n「我只說這是骨模第一次被打造出來，我可沒說這是人們初次學會這種手藝。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「那有人第一次把這種手藝教導給某人，又是什麼時候？」葛拉茲問。\r\n\r\n\r\n「那個呀，我的朋友，」霍格德露出可惡的微笑。「就留待另一個夜晚吧。」","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book2CommonBonePartII","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02026D59|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK FULL","original":"Recipe - Jumping Shock Spider","string":"配方 - 閃電跳蛛","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2ExpSpiderCrftBookShockJumping","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"0201DA0F|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<p align='center'><font face='$HandwrittenFont'><font size='25'>\r\n\r\n\r\nRuby Gem\r\n\r\nDamaged Albino Spider Pod\r\n\r\n</font></p>\r\n","string":"<p align='center'><font face='$HandwrittenFont'><font size='25'>\r\n\r\n\r\n紅寶石\r\n\r\n受損的白化蜘蛛卵囊\r\n\r\n</font></p>","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2ExpSpiderCrftBookFireBomb","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02027E4E|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face='$HandwrittenFont'><font size='18'>\r\nI am stronger now.

He was feverish, neither asleep nor awake, screaming at invisible phantoms. The healers complimented the young man's fortitude. Bodies had washed ashore on the island of Gorne several times, many during the War, but never once had they seen one that lived afterwards.\r\n \r\n\r\nAunt Ulliah came in several times to bring Baynarah food: \"You must be careful, dear, or when he's all well, he'll have to attend you on your sickbed.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nTay's fever broke, and at last he was able to open his eyes and see the young woman with whom he had spent seventeen years, all but the first year of his life. She smiled at him, and called for food. In silence, she helped him eat.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I knew you wouldn't die, cousin,\" she whispered fondly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"I hoped to, but somehow I knew I wouldn't either,\" he groaned. \"Baynarah, do you remember all those nightmares I told you about? They're all true.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"We can talk about it when you've rested some more.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he croaked. \"I must tell you everything now, so you'll know what kind of a monster you call your dear cousin Tay. If there was some way you could have known before, you might not have been so eager to see me well again.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nA tear rolled Baynarah's cheek. She had grown into a beauty, even in the few months he had been away in Mournhold. \"How can you think I would stop loving you, no matter what you've done?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I saw my old nursemaid Edebah, and spoke to her.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" Baynarah had feared this moment. \"Tay, I don't know what she told you, but it was all my fault. You remember when Kena Grafisi taught us about the House Dagoth, and its corruption. That night, I saw your nursemaid making some kind of altar out on the north lawn, using the symbol of the Sixth House. She must have been doing it for years, but I never knew what it meant. I told Uncle Triffith, and he sent her away. I've wanted to tell you so many times now, but I was afraid to. She was so devoted to you.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nTay smiled. \"And didn't it frighten you even more to wonder if there was any connection between her devotion to me, and her devotion to the accursed House? I know you, Baynarah. You're not one of those women who doesn't choose to use her mind.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Tay, I don't know what she told you, but I think she was very troubled, and whatever she thought about you and the Sixth House was wrong. You have to remember that. The ramblings of one madwoman are proof of nothing.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"There's more,\" Tay sighed, and held up his hand. For a moment he blinked, and then turned to Baynarah angrily. \"What happened to my ring? If you saw it, you must have known already that everything I'm saying to you is true.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I threw the filthy thing away,\" Baynarah stood up. \"Tay, I'm going to let you rest now.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I am the heir of House Dagoth,\" Tay was wild-eyed, almost screaming. \"Raised after the War as House Indoril, but driven by the Song of my ancestors. When we were young, I killed Vaster because the Song told me he had stolen my inheritance. When Edebah told me who I was and gave me this ring, I killed her and burned her house to the ground, because the Song told me she had served her purpose. When I returned to Kalkorith's house, my love was there, telling me that she was of the House Dagoth too, and my sister. I fled, and when Kalkorith tried to stop me, I slew him, because the Song told me he was an enemy.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Tay, stop,\" Baynarah sobbed. \"I don't believe a word of it. You've been feverish...\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Not Tay,\" he shook his head, breathing heavily. \"The name my parents gave me was Dagoth-Tython.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"You can't have killed Edebah, you loved her. And Vaster and Kalkorith? They were our cousins!\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"They were not my true cousins,\" Tay said coldly. \"The Song told me they were my foes. Just as it's telling me now that you're my foe, but I won't listen. And I'll keep from listening... as long as I can.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nBaynarah fled from the room, slamming the door behind her. She took a key from the her startled maid Hillima, and secured the lock.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Serjo Indoril-Baynarah,\" Hillima whispered, with great sympathy. \"Is all well with your cousin, Serjo Indoril-Tay?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"He'll be perfectly fine once he rests,\" Baynarah recovered her dignity, wiping the tears from her face. \"No one is to disturb him under any circumstances. I'll take the key with me. Now I have much work to do. I don't suppose anyone's spoken to the fishermen about restocking Sandil House's supplies?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I don't know, serjo,\" said the maid. \"I don't think so.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nBaynarah marched down to the docks, and relieved her troubled heart the only way she knew how, by concentrating on small things. Tay's words never left her, but she found temporary comfort talking to the fishermen about their haul, helping determine how much should be smoked, how much should be sent to the village, how much should be delivered fresh to the House larder.\r\n \r\n\r\nHer aunt Ulliah joined the discussion, oblivious to Baynarah's well-disguised agony. Together, they discussed how many provisions Uncle Triffith and his commanders had devoured during their weeks on the island, when they would be expected to return, and how best to prepare. One of the fishermen on the docks called out, interrupting.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"A boat is coming!\" \r\n\r\n\r\nUlliah and Baynarah greeted the visitor as she arrived. It was a young woman dressed in the robes of a Temple priestess. As she docked her small boat, Baynarah marveled at how beautiful she was, and strangely familiar.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Welcome to Gorne,\" said Baynarah. \"I am Indoril-Baynarah and this is my aunt Indoril-Ulliah. Have we met before?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I don't believe so, serjo,\" the woman bowed. \"I was sent by the Temple to inquire whether word had come from your cousin, Indoril-Tay. He has been missing from his classes for some days now, and the priests have become concerned.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Oh, we should have sent word,\" Ulliah fretted. \"He came here a few days ago, half-drowned. He's better now. Let us escort you up to the house.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Tay's resting now, and I asked that he not be disturbed,\" Baynarah stammered. \"Actually, I know it's dreadful manners, but I need to talk to my aunt for a moment. Would it be too terrible if I asked you to wait for us at the house? You have only to follow the path up the hill and across the lawn.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nThe priestess bowed again humbly, and began the walk. Ulliah was scandalized. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"You know better than to treat a representative of the Temple that way,\" she snapped. \"You can't be so exhausted from tending your cousin to have lost all sense of civility.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Aunt Ulliah,\" Baynarah whispered, drawing the woman away from the ears of the fishermen. \"Is Tay truly my cousin? He believes himself to be ... of the House Dagoth.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nUlliah took a moment to respond. \"It's true. You were just a baby yourself during the War, so you couldn't know what it was like. There was not a part of Morrowind that wasn't ravaged. There was even a battle here on the island. Do you remember that burned pile of wreckage you and Tay and poor little Vaster discovered so many years ago? That was the remains. And after the War, when that accursed House was finally defeated, we saw the little innocents, the orphans whose only crime had been born to wicked parents. I admit there were some in our armies, the combined forces of the Houses, who would have had them all slaughtered to annihilate the legacy of Dagoth. In the end, compassion prevailed, and the children of the Sixth House were adopted into the other five. And so we thought that we had won the war and the peace.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"By the Mother, Lord, and Wizard, if all that Tay believes is true, then there is no peace,\" Baynarah trembled. \"He claims that the Song of his ancestors called to him, and forced him to slay three people, two of them our Housemen. Cousin Kalkorith and ... when he was a little boy ... Vaster.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nUlliah held her hands over her tearful face and could not speak. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"And it is only beginning,\" said Baynara. \"The Song still calls to him. He said there were others who knew, who would help him raise up the Sixth House. His sister...\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"It must be an evil fantasy,\" Ulliah murmured. She noticed that Baynarah's gaze was now upon the path leading from the docks towards the house. \"Niece, what are you thinking?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Did that priestess give us her name?\" \r\n\r\n\r\nThe two women ran up the path, calling for guards. The fishermen, who had never seen the mistresses of the house so undone, looked briefly at one another and then followed quickly behind, pulling out their hooks and blades.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe front gate to Sandil House stood wide open, the first of the corpses lying close within. It was now an abattoir, painted fresh with blood. There was Aner, uncle Triffith's valet, gutted but still seated at the foyer table where he had been enjoying his afternoon glass of flin. Leryne, one of the chambermaids, had been decapitated while carrying some once-clean linens up the stairs. The bodies of guards and servants sprawled about the hall like blown leaves. At the top of the stairs, Baynarah had to hold back a sob when she saw Hillima. She lay like a broken doll, slain as she tried to pull herself out onto the narrow window ledge.\r\n \r\n\r\nNo one spoke, not Baynarah, nor Aunt Ulliah, nor the fishermen, as they walked slowly through the blood-drenched house. They passed Tay's sick-room, its door broken open, and no one within. When they heard the sound of footsteps in Baynarah's room down the hall, they approached slowly, cautiously, with great dread.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe priestess from the docks was standing by the bed. In her hand was the silver ring Baynarah had taken from Tay's finger. In her other hand was a long, curved blade, splashed like her once pristine gown, with gore. She smiled prettily and bowed when she saw she was no longer alone.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Acra, I should have recognized you by Tay's description in his letters,\" Baynarah said in her steadiest voice. \"Where is my cousin?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I prefer to call myself Dagoth-Acra,\" she replied. \"Your false cousin, my true brother, has already gone to fulfill his destiny. I'm sorry you were not here so he could give you a more permanent farewell.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nBaynarah's face twisted in fury. She motioned for the fishermen, who advanced with their weaponry. \"Tear her apart.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"The Sixth House will rise again, and Dagoth-Tython will lead us!\" Acra laughed. Her words were still echoing as she gave the sign of Recall and vanished like a ghost.\r\n ","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n毒藥之頌\r\n第五冊\r\n\r\n畢斯汀．謝爾 \r\n著\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/F_letter.png'>整整兩天，家族治療師連連探視臥病在床的泰伊，而蓓娜拉也坐在床榻邊，握著他的手。他高燒不退，意識不清，對著看不見的幽靈吶喊。治療師讚嘆年輕人的好運。以前也有人被沖到葛尼島沿岸，很多是在戰爭期間，但這是他們第一次遇到有人能活過浩劫。\r\n\r\n\r\n烏黎雅姑姑來過好幾次，替蓓娜拉送來食物。「妳要照顧好自己，親愛的，不然等他好轉，就換他去給妳探病了。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊的高燒退了，而且終於能夠睜開眼，看看陪伴了他十七年的年輕女人，她一直都在他身旁，除了他人生的第一年。她對他微笑，叫來食物，然後默默地協助他進食。 \r\n\r\n\r\n「我知道你熬得過，堂弟，」她真摯地低語。\r\n\r\n\r\n「我倒希望能一了百了，但我好像也心知肚明自己會活下來，」他呻吟。「蓓娜拉，妳還記得我曾跟妳說過的那些惡夢嗎？它們都是真的。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「你先多休息，以後再說那些吧。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「不行，」他低啞地說。「我必須現在就把所有事情告訴妳，妳才知道妳所謂親愛的堂弟泰伊，是怎樣的怪物。如果妳有辦法及早知道這些，或許就不會這麼殷切地盼望我好轉了。」\r\n\r\n\r\n一滴淚珠滑落蓓娜拉的臉頰。她已經成為一名美人，在他停留哀傷之城的幾個月期間甚至出落得愈發標緻。「無論你做了什麼，你怎麼可以認為我會停止愛你？」\r\n \r\n\r\n「我見到以前的保母艾蒂芭，而且跟她說了話。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「噢，」蓓娜拉一直害怕此刻的到來。「泰伊，我不知道她跟你說了什麼，但那全是我的錯。你記得基納．嘉甫希跟我們講述達格斯家族和其腐敗的那天吧，那天晚上，我看到你的保母在北方草坪上設了某種祭壇，排出第六家族的符號。她一定已經那樣好多年了，但是我從不知道那代表什麼。我跟崔斐斯叔叔說了這件事，他就把她趕走了。好幾次我都想告訴你，可是我太害怕了。她是那麼愛你。」\r\n\r\n\r\n泰伊露出微笑。「她對我的忠誠奉獻是否和她對那該受詛咒的家族有關連，當這種可能性的疑問浮上妳腦海時，難道沒讓妳更害怕嗎？我了解妳，蓓娜拉，妳不是那種不動腦的女人。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「泰伊，我不知道她跟你說了什麼，但我認為她非常不安，不管她認為你跟第六家族有什麼關係，都不是真的。你必須牢牢記住。一個瘋女人的穿鑿附會證明不了什麼。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「還有其他證明，」泰伊嘆口氣，舉起手。他驚愕了一下，然後生氣地轉向蓓娜拉。「我的戒指呢？如果妳看到了，那妳一定早就明白我跟妳說的全是真的。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「我把那個邪惡的東西扔了，」蓓娜拉站起來。「泰伊，我不吵你，好好休息。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「我是達格斯家的繼承人，」泰伊激動不已，聲調幾與尖叫無異。「戰後被養在因督利爾家，但卻受我的先祖之頌驅使。我們還小的時候，我殺了瓦士特，因為那首歌說他偷了我的東西。當艾蒂芭告訴我我的真實身分並給我這個戒指時，我殺了她並放火燒光一切，因為那首歌說她的任務已盡。我回到凱寇里斯家，我的愛人在那裡等我，說她也是達格斯家的成員，而且還是我妹妹。我奪門而出，在凱寇里斯試圖阻止我時，我割斷他的喉嚨，因為那首歌說他是敵人。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「泰伊，夠了，」蓓娜拉啜泣著。「我一個字都不相信。你發了高燒……」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「我不是泰伊，」他猛搖頭，呼吸沉重。「我父母給我的名字，是達格斯．泰伊松。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「你不可能殺死艾蒂芭，你愛她。瓦士特和凱寇里斯？他們是我們的血親哪！」\r\n\r\n\r\n「他們跟我沒有關係，」泰伊冷冷地說。「那首歌說他們是敵人，就像它正要我相信妳是我的敵人，但我不聽。我會一直抗拒……只要我有辦法。」\r\n\r\n\r\n蓓娜拉奔出房間，把門甩上。她從飽受驚嚇的女僕喜莉瑪手上拿過鑰匙，緊緊把門鎖上。 \r\n\r\n\r\n「因督利爾．蓓娜拉小姐，」喜莉瑪小聲開口，語帶同情。「妳的堂弟因督利爾．泰伊還好嗎？」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「只要好好休息，他就會完全康復，」蓓娜拉重拾莊重與尊嚴，揩去臉上的淚水。「任何情況下都不准打擾他，鑰匙由我帶著。我還有很多事情要忙。我想還沒有人跟漁夫談過替杉笛爾之屋重添補給吧？」\r\n\r\n\r\n「我不清楚，小姐，」女僕回道。「我想沒有。」\r\n\r\n\r\n蓓娜拉往下走到碼頭，打算專心處理小事情，用她僅知的方式安撫躁動的心情。泰伊的話揮之不去，但藉由跟漁夫討論漁獲量，協助決定多少該煙燻處理，多少該送去村裡，以及多少該趁新鮮送往大屋的食品室，她依然設法找到片刻寧靜。\r\n\r\n\r\n她的姑姑烏黎雅也加入討論，絲毫沒有發現蓓娜拉高明偽裝下的痛苦。她們討論著崔斐斯叔叔和那些議員在島上作客這段期間吃了多少食物，他們預計何時離開，怎樣準備最好。突然一個漁夫從碼頭上大喊，打斷了討論。\r\n\r\n\r\n「有船靠近！」\r\n\r\n\r\n烏黎雅和蓓娜拉跟造訪者致意，那是個穿著神殿女祭司長袍的年輕女人。等她順利讓小船靠岸，她驚為天人的美貌和奇異的熟悉感，都讓蓓娜拉詫異不已。\r\n\r\n\r\n「歡迎來到葛尼島，」蓓娜拉開口。「我是因督利爾．蓓娜拉，這是我的姑姑因督利爾．烏黎雅。我們以前見過面嗎？」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「我想沒有，」女人欠個身。「神殿派我來探詢，看看妳是否有收到堂弟因督利爾．泰伊的音訊。他已經缺課多日，祭司們開始擔心了。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「噢，我們應該要送個信息的，」烏黎雅一臉苦惱。「他幾天前到了島上，差點淹死，不過現在好多了。請容我們護送妳到大屋吧。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「泰伊現在在休息，我不希望他被打擾，」蓓娜拉有些結巴。「呃，雖然有些失禮，但我得跟我姑姑私下說個話。如果請妳先行到屋裡等我們，希望不會太冒昧。妳只要沿著山坡小徑走，再穿過草地就到了。」\r\n\r\n\r\n女祭司再次謙遜地鞠躬，然後離去。烏黎雅震驚不已。\r\n\r\n\r\n「妳居然這樣對待神殿的代表，」她破口大罵。「照看堂弟不至於讓妳累到禮儀盡失吧。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「烏黎雅姑姑，」蓓娜拉把婦人拉到一旁，確保漁夫不會聽到，才低聲開口。「泰伊真的是我的堂弟嗎？他認為他是……達格斯家的人。」\r\n\r\n\r\n烏黎雅沉默了一下，才終於回答。「沒錯。戰爭發生時，妳還是個嬰孩，不知道那時的慘況。晨風省滿目瘡痍，就連島上都發生過戰役。還記得好多年前，妳、泰伊和可憐的瓦士特發現的那堆燒毀殘骸嗎？那些就是戰爭的遺跡。戰爭結束後，那個該詛咒的家族終於潰敗，我們看到那些無辜的孩子，這些孤兒唯一的罪過就是有邪惡的父母。我承認有些家族聯軍的成員，當初贊成將他們趕盡殺絕，徹底殲滅達格斯家，斷了他們的血脈。不過最終憐憫之心還是佔了上風，那些第六家族的孩子被其他五個家族所收養。我們以為我們同時贏得了戰役和和平。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「以神母、上主和巫師之名，如果泰伊深信的一切都是真的，就不可能和平，」 蓓娜拉渾身顫抖。「他宣稱他的先祖之歌召喚著他，迫使他殺害了三個人，其中兩人是我們的家人，凱寇里斯和……他小時候動的手……瓦士特。」\r\n\r\n\r\n烏黎雅用雙手遮住自己淚濕的臉，無法言語。\r\n\r\n\r\n「這些只是開始，」蓓娜拉說。「那首歌依然對他傳送著信息。他說還有其他人知道事情始末，他們會幫他復興第六家族。他妹妹……」\r\n\r\n\r\n「這一定是某種邪惡的幻想，」烏黎雅喃喃自語。她發現蓓娜拉正盯著從碼頭通往大屋的小徑。「姪女啊，妳在想什麼？」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「那個女祭司有跟我們說她的名字嗎？」\r\n\r\n\r\n兩個女人飛快跑過小徑，一邊呼喊守衛。那些漁夫從沒見過屋子的女主人如此失控，先是互相張望，然後立刻拿出他們的魚鉤和刀劍緊跟在後。\r\n\r\n\r\n杉笛爾之屋的前門大大敞開，第一具屍體躺在門口不遠處。如今屋子成了屠宰場，鮮血滿布。崔斐斯叔叔的貼身男僕阿耐開膛破肚，但依然坐在原本正享用著午後飛令的門廳桌旁；房務女僕萊瑞妮本來正捧著亞麻上樓，如今卻斷了頭；守衛和僕人屍橫大廳，彷彿遭吹落的樹葉。在樓梯頂端，蓓娜拉看到喜莉瑪，差點失聲驚叫。她像個破碎的娃娃躺在那兒，她試圖穿過窗戶逃到外頭的狹窄壁架上，卻依然慘死刀下。\r\n\r\n\r\n蓓娜拉、烏黎雅姑姑、漁夫緩緩走過血洗大屋，所有人都默不出聲。他們經過泰伊的病房，房間已被破門而入，但裡面空無一人。當聽到有腳步聲從廊道底端蓓娜拉的房間傳出來，一行人小心翼翼地慢慢靠近，滿懷恐懼。\r\n\r\n\r\n碼頭上的那個女祭司站在床邊，而蓓娜拉從泰伊手上拿下來的銀戒此刻就在她手中。她的另一隻手握著一把彎曲的長劍，連同她原本潔淨的長袍，都濺上了血跡。她發現自己不再是獨自一人，隨即露出美麗的笑容，然後鞠躬。\r\n\r\n\r\n「雅可拉，泰伊在信裡描述了這麼多，我早該認出是妳，」蓓娜拉盡可能鎮定地說。「我的堂弟在哪裡？」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「我比較喜歡自稱達格斯．雅可拉，」她回應。「妳的假堂弟、我的真兄長，已經前去完成他的使命。真遺憾妳不在這裡，不然他就能跟妳來個更永久的道別。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n蓓娜拉的臉因憤怒而扭曲。她對那些帶著武器上前的漁夫示意：「殺了她。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「第六家族會重振旗鼓，達格斯．泰伊松將是我們的領袖！」雅可拉大笑，在她使出傳送術如鬼影消失無蹤之際，那些字句依然在房內迴盪。","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book1CheapPoisonSong5","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02028273|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Poison Song\r\n\r\nBook VI \r\n\r\nBy Bristin Xel \r\n\r\n\r\nThe magnificent sprawl of the stronghold of Indoranyon was aglow in the light of the setting sun. Commander Jasrat watched it slowly disappear into the horizon as he led the caravan southwestward. It was a strange practice for him to lead a night operation, but scarcely more bizarre than anything else he was facing. He was only seventy years of age, far from old for a Bosmer, and yet he felt like he belonged to another era.\r\n \r\n\r\nHe had known the land of east Vvardenfell his entire life. Every forest, every garden, every small village between Red Mountain and the Sea of Ghosts had been home to him. But now it was all different, twisted into a world he did not recognize since the eruption and the year of Sun's Death. It made night travel all the more treacherous, but it was a risk he was ordered to take.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe ashmire appeared quite suddenly. If a sharp-sighted scout hadn't seen it and given the signal, the entire caravan might have been swallowed whole. Jasrat cursed. It had not been on the map, but that was hardly surprising.\r\n \r\n\r\nIt was a huge unnamed scathe stretching as far as anyone could see. The commander considered his options. He might lead his party to the southeast toward Tel Aruhn and then try an approach due west. As he consulted his map, he noticed a glimmer of a campfire in the distance. Accompanied by his lieutenants, Jasrat drove his guar forward to investigate what appeared to be an Ashlander man and woman.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"This is no longer your realm,\" he bellowed. \"Don't you know it's been ruled by the Temple that these are House lands now?\"\r\n \r\n\r\nThe couple shuffled to their feet, and began quietly walking away, toward a narrow ridge between hill and ashmire. Jasrat called them back.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Do you know a way around the scathe?\" he asked. They nodded, their eyes still to the ground. Jasrat signaled to his caravan. \"You will lead us then.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nIt was a treacherous winding crossing, almost too tight for the guars. The wagons themselves scraped as the drivers pulled to avoid the ashmire. The Ashlander man and woman whispered to one another as they led the caravan.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"What are you mumbling about, n'wah?\" Jasrat hollered. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe man did not turn around. \"My sister and I were talking about the Dagoth rebellion, and she was guessing that you were bringing arms to the stronghold at Falensarano, which is why you chose to cross the ashmire rather than taking a road.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I might have known,\" Jasrat laughed. \"You Ashlanders are so hopeful whenever you see signs of trouble in the Houses and the Temple. I hate to dampen your spirits, but what you're speaking of is hardly a rebellion. Merely a few isolated incidents of... unpleasantness. Tell your sister that.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nAs they plodded onward, the narrow ridge began to taper even more. The Ashlanders found a low jagged crevasse in the hills, a crack from a lava flow even predating Sun's Death. The caravan scored the rock walls at it moved through. Commander Jasrat, after twenty years of uncertainty in a land he did not understand, felt a twinge of his old instinct. This, he thought to himself, would be a fine place for an ambush.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Ashlander, how close are we?\" he shouted. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"We've arrived,\" Dagoth-Tython replied, and gave the signal. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe assault was over in mere minutes, as it had been calculated from the start. When the last body of the House guard had sunk beneath the ashmire, only then was the inventory of the caravan revealed. It was better than they had hoped, virtually everything the rebellion needed. Daedric swords, dozens of suits of armor, quivers of fine ebony bolts, and rations enough to last for weeks.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Go on ahead to the camp,\" Tython smiled at his sister. \"I'll lead the caravan. We should be there within a few hours' time.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nAcra kissed him passionately, and gave the sign of Recall. In an instant, she was back in her tent, exactly as she had left it. Humming the Song, she removed the Ashlander rags and chose an appropriately diaphanous gown from her trunks. Precisely the sort of dress Tython would love seeing her in when he returned.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Muorasa!\" she called to her servant. \"Summon the troops together! Tython and the others will be here very soon with all the weapons and rations we need!\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Muorasa can't hear you now,\" said a voice Acra hadn't heard in weeks. She turned, expertly removed every trace of surprise from her face. It was indeed Indoril-Baynarah, but not the quivering creature she had left behind at the massacre at Sandil House. This woman was an armored warrior, who spoke with mocking confidence. \"She wouldn't be able to summon the troops if she could. You may have weapons and rations, Acra, but there's no one left to arm or feed.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nDagoth-Acra made the sign of Recall, but nothing happened. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"The moment we heard you banging around in the tent, my battlemages cast a diffusion of all magicka,\" Baynara smiled, opening the tent further to invite a dozen House soldiers in. \"You won't be leaving.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"If you think that my brother will walk into your trap, you underestimate his allegiance to the Song,\" Acra sneered. \"It tells him everything he needs to know. I have convinced him to no longer fight it, and let it lead him and us to our ultimate victory.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"I've known him longer and better than you ever did,\" said Baynarah coldly. \"Now, I want to hear what the Song is saying to you. I want to know where I can find Tay.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Tython, my lady,\" Acra corrected her. \"He is no longer a slave to your House and the Temple's lies. You can torture me all you wish, but I swear to you the next time you see him, it will be because he wishes it, not you. And that will be your very last moment alive.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Don't you worry, serjo,\" Baynarah's nightblade winked at her. \"Everyone says they won't break under torture, but everyone always does.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nBaynarah left the tent. It was all a part of warfare, she understood that, but there would be little relish in witnessing it. She could not even watch as the House soldiers disposed of the rebel corpses. She had hoped she would grow numb to the bloodshed after weeks of following Tython and Acra, massacre after massacre. It didn't matter to her that now the bodies were of her enemies. Death was still death.\r\n \r\n\r\nShe had only been in her tent for a few minutes when her nightblade appeared. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not so tough as she appeared, that one,\" he grinned. \"In point of fact, all I had to do is ask her nice and point my dagger at her belly, and she was blubbering everything. Not too surprising really. It's always the ones that talk big that crumble fast. I remember way back a couple years ago, before you was even born -\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Garuan, what did she say?\" Baynarah asked. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Song, whatever that is, told her brother that she got herself caught, and not to return to camp,\" the nightblade replied, only a trifle annoyed at having his fascinating story cut short. \"He's got a half dozen mer with him, and they're going to try to assassinate the fella that led the Indoril army in the War. General Indoril-Triffith.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Uncle Triffith,\" Baynarah gasped. \"Where is he stationed now?\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure myself, serjo. Do you want me to ask if she knows?\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'll come with you,\" said Baynarah. As they walked towards Acra's tent, cries of alarm sounded. The situation became abundantly clear even before they reached the site. Three guards were dead, and the prisoner had escaped.\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Interesting woman,\" said Garuan. \"Weak heart, but a strong arm. Should we send word of warning to General Indoril-Triffith?\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\"If we can find where he is in time,\" said Baynarah.","string":"[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n毒藥之頌\r\n第六冊\r\n\r\n畢斯汀．謝爾 \r\n著\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[pagebreak]\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>蔭都雷尼昂要塞的壯觀建築在夕陽照耀下鍍上紅光。賈思萊指揮官帶領著車隊往西南方前進，看著落日漸漸消失於地平線。在夜間行動不是他的一貫作風，不過比起他眼前所見，這實在沒什麼大不了。他才七十歲，對「波茲莫」而言還是壯年，但他卻覺得自己屬於另一個紀元。\r\n\r\n\r\n他對東瓦登費爾再熟悉不過。介於紅山和鬼魂之海間的每片森林、每座花園、每個小村落，都像他的家。但自從日亡年紅山爆發之後，現在全不一樣了，如今夜間旅行更為險惡，但這是他奉命要冒的險。\r\n\r\n\r\n灰燼泥沼的出現有些出乎意料，要不是有個眼尖的偵查兵事先看到並發出警告，搞不好全車隊就陷入其中了。賈思萊咒罵一聲。這個泥沼不在地圖上，但那實在不足為奇。\r\n\r\n\r\n這片無名泥地漫無邊際，指揮官思索著可行的辦法。或許他可以把隊伍帶往東南方的泰爾亞魯，然後再西轉。他研究著地圖，注意到遠方閃著營火的火光。在副手的陪同下，賈思萊騎著他的軋獸前往偵查，發現了一對灰燼人男女。\r\n\r\n\r\n「這裡不再是你們的土地，」他大聲喝道。「難道你們不知道這裡已由神殿治理，如今屬於家族領土嗎？」 \r\n\r\n\r\n那對男女有些笨拙地站起來，慢慢走開，往夾在山丘和灰燼泥沼之間的狹長山脊而去。\r\n \r\n\r\n「你們知道繞過這片湮沒之境的路嗎？」他問。他們點頭，目光依然直視地面。賈思萊對車隊示意。「那麼帶路吧。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n這條險道曲折崎嶇，軋獸幾乎寸步難行，車夫扯緊了篷車，避開灰燼泥沼，車體因而發出刺耳的聲音。這對灰燼人男女領著車隊前進，兩人低聲交頭接耳。\r\n\r\n\r\n「死奴隸，你們嘀咕些什麼？」賈思萊大吼。\r\n\r\n\r\n男人沒有轉身。「我妹妹和我在說達格斯叛亂，她猜你們要將武器運往法聯撒拉諾要塞，所以才會選擇越過灰燼泥沼而不走大路。」\r\n\r\n\r\n賈思萊大笑。「我早知道你們灰燼人迫不及待想看到家族和神殿出現麻煩。抱歉潑冷水，不過你們提到的問題根本稱不上叛亂，只是幾樁零星的……惱人事件。把這些跟你妹妹說。」\r\n\r\n\r\n他們沉重又緩慢地繼續前進，狹長的山脊開始越來越窄。灰燼人在丘陵中找到一條鋸齒狀的淺裂縫，這由岩漿造成的縫隙形成之時甚至早於日亡。車隊穿越其中，刮過岩壁。在不熟悉土地上遊走了二十年，賈思萊指揮官深知事物變幻無常的道理，他的直覺發出警訊。這是設下埋伏的完美地點，他心想。\r\n\r\n\r\n「灰燼人，快到了嗎？」他吼道。\r\n\r\n\r\n「我們已經到了，」達格斯．泰伊松回答，發出訊號。\r\n\r\n\r\n這波攻擊以迅雷不及掩耳之勢結束。直到最後一名家族守衛的屍體沉入灰燼泥沼，車隊的運載物資才終於曝光。結果比他們的期望更好，幾乎滿足了策動叛亂的所有需求。魔族劍、數十套盔甲、插滿一袋袋箭套的黑檀箭，和足以撐上好幾星期的口糧。\r\n\r\n\r\n「先回營地去，」泰伊松對妹妹微笑。「我來帶領車隊。我們應該幾個小時就會到了。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n雅可拉熱情地吻他，然後使出傳送術。眨眼間她便回到自己的帳篷，之前她也是這樣離開的。她哼著那首歌，脫下灰燼人的破爛裝束，然後從箱子裡挑了一件近乎透明的長袍穿上，正是泰伊松回來時會樂於看到她穿著的衣物。\r\n\r\n\r\n「默萊莎！」她叫喚著僕人。「趕快召集軍隊！泰伊松很快就會和其他人帶著我們需要的武器和糧食回來！」\r\n\r\n\r\n「默萊莎現在聽不到，」一個雅可拉好幾週未曾聽聞的聲音回道。她轉身，高明地藏住所有的驚訝情緒。那個女人確實是因督利爾．蓓娜拉，但卻不是那個她留在杉笛爾之屋屠殺現場的發抖可憐鬼。眼前的女人是名武裝戰士，說話時帶著一種嘲弄的自信。「她無法召集軍隊。雅可拉，或許妳有武器和軍糧，但卻沒有可以拿武器或吃糧食的人。」\r\n\r\n\r\n達格斯．雅可拉使出傳送術，可是毫無動靜。\r\n\r\n\r\n「一聽到妳在帳篷裡砰砰作響，我們的戰場法師就施法讓所有法力消散，」蓓娜拉微微一笑，打開帳篷引進其他家族士兵。\r\n\r\n\r\n「如果妳以為我哥哥會中妳的圈套，妳就太小看他對那首歌的忠誠了，」雅可拉譏笑道。「所有該知道的事，那首歌都會跟他說。我確信他已經不再抗拒它，而是跟隨它的指引，以達成我們的最終勝利。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「我對他的認識，比妳久也比妳深入，」蓓娜拉語調冷酷。「現在，我要知道那首歌跟妳說了什麼，我要知道哪裡才能找到泰伊。」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「是泰伊松，我的女士，」雅可拉糾正她。「他已經不是你們家族和神殿謊言下的奴隸了。妳想怎麼折磨我都行，但我保證妳如果見到他，是因為他願意，而不是妳想，並且那將是妳活著的最後時刻。\r\n\r\n\r\n「不勞妳操心，小姐，」蓓娜拉的夜刃衛士朝她眨眨眼。「大家都說他們不會被折磨打垮，但最終每個人總會崩潰。 \r\n\r\n\r\n蓓娜拉離開帳篷。這些全是戰事的一部分，她明白，可是親眼目睹並不是什麼樂事。她甚至受不了看到家族士兵棄置叛亂份子的屍體。幾星期以來，她追逐著泰伊松和雅可拉，經歷一場又一場的殺戮，她曾希望能對這一切血腥暴力變得麻木不仁。就算這些屍體是她的敵人，也沒讓她好過一些，死亡就是死亡。\r\n\r\n\r\n她才回到她的帳篷幾分鐘，夜刃衛士就來了。\r\n\r\n\r\n「一副強悍的樣子，也不過爾爾，」他咧開嘴。「事實上，我只不過好聲好氣詢問，順道用匕首指著她的肚子，她就全吐出來了。我倒是不太驚訝。說大話的總是最快垮的。我記得好多年以前，妳都還沒出生呢——」\r\n\r\n\r\n「甘盧安，她說了什麼？」蓓娜拉問道。\r\n\r\n\r\n「那首歌——天知道那是什麼——告訴她哥哥，她被抓了，叫他不要回來營地，」那名夜刃衛士回答，對他的精采故事被打斷了有點不高興。「他手下有六個精靈，他們打算刺殺紅山戰役時領導因督利爾軍隊的傢伙。因督利爾．崔斐斯將軍。」\r\n\r\n\r\n「是崔斐斯叔叔，」蓓娜拉倒抽一口氣。「他現在駐紮在哪裡？」\r\n\r\n\r\n「我不確定，小姐。妳要我問問她嗎？」\r\n\r\n\r\n「我跟你去，」蓓娜拉說。他們朝雅可拉的帳篷走去，警報突然響起，即使他們還沒走到目的地，卻已經對情勢了然於胸。他們失去三名守衛，而囚犯不見蹤影。\r\n\r\n\r\n「很有趣的女人，」甘盧安說。「內心脆弱，手勁卻很強。我們是不是該送出警告信給因督利爾．崔斐斯將軍？」 \r\n\r\n\r\n「如果我們能及時找出他在哪裡，」蓓娜拉說。","index":null,"editor_id":"DLC2Book1CheapPoisonSong6","status":"TranslationComplete"},{"form_id":"02020A44|Dragonborn.esm","type":"BOOK DESC","original":"<font face='$HandwrittenFont'>\r\nGratian,\r\n\r\nI would appreciate if you could help us with a situation we've encountered in Raven Rock.
