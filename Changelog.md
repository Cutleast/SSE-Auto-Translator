# v1.1.0

##### This Update requires a complete wipe of your existing SSE-AT data!! This is a one-time only and we think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

  - Masterlist is hosted in GitHub repository
  - At time of writing, only a german masterlist is provided and **we need people to maintain masterlists for other languages** as well
  - If you want to maintain a masterlist for a language or you know of translations that are on Nexus Mods but are not visible in the translations of the original mod then please join our Discord and tell us

    - due to this, xTranslator import had to be removed
  - For a list of complete changes, see Documentation at DSD repository
  - This fixes a lot of potential issues like mismatching of translation and original strings or not replacing of strings ingame
  - This also fixes several decoding errors previously happening in some plugins
  - **Old translations have to be ported by following these steps for each plugin**
    1. Export the translation
    2. Delete translation from database
    3. Scan plugin so that it's marked as *Translation Required*
    4. Create new translation for plugin via right-click
    5. Click on the third button in the editor tab and choose the respective json file from your previously exported translation
    6. Click on "Done" and the translation should now be ported into the new format. (Recommended to save after this)
- Completely regenerated Vanilla Database
  - The old Database was exported via xTranslator and lacked a lot of strings, this means that it's now approx. double in size
